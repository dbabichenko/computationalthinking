      "To the People of the State of New York:\n",
      "\n",
      "AFTER an unequivocal experience of the inefficacy of the subsisting\n",
      "federal government, you are called upon to deliberate on a new\n",
      "Constitution for the United States of America. The subject speaks its\n",
      "own importance; comprehending in its consequences nothing less than the\n",
      "existence of the UNION, the safety and welfare of the parts of which it\n",
      "is composed, the fate of an empire in many respects the most interesting\n",
      "in the world. It has been frequently remarked that it seems to have been\n",
      "reserved to the people of this country, by their conduct and example,\n",
      "to decide the important question, whether societies of men are really\n",
      "capable or not of establishing good government from reflection and\n",
      "choice, or whether they are forever destined to depend for their\n",
      "political constitutions on accident and force. If there be any truth\n",
      "in the remark, the crisis at which we are arrived may with propriety be\n",
      "regarded as the era in which that decision is to be made; and a wrong\n",
      "election of the part we shall act may, in this view, deserve to be\n",
      "considered as the general misfortune of mankind.\n",
      "\n",
      "This idea will add the inducements of philanthropy to those of\n",
      "patriotism, to heighten the solicitude which all considerate and good\n",
      "men must feel for the event. Happy will it be if our choice should be\n",
      "directed by a judicious estimate of our true interests, unperplexed and\n",
      "unbiased by considerations not connected with the public good. But this\n",
      "is a thing more ardently to be wished than seriously to be expected. The\n",
      "plan offered to our deliberations affects too many particular interests,\n",
      "innovates upon too many local institutions, not to involve in its\n",
      "discussion a variety of objects foreign to its merits, and of views,\n",
      "passions and prejudices little favorable to the discovery of truth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among the most formidable of the obstacles which the new Constitution\n",
      "will have to encounter may readily be distinguished the obvious interest\n",
      "of a certain class of men in every State to resist all changes which\n",
      "may hazard a diminution of the power, emolument, and consequence of\n",
      "the offices they hold under the State establishments; and the perverted\n",
      "ambition of another class of men, who will either hope to aggrandize\n",
      "themselves by the confusions of their country, or will flatter\n",
      "themselves with fairer prospects of elevation from the subdivision of\n",
      "the empire into several partial confederacies than from its union under\n",
      "one government.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is not, however, my design to dwell upon observations of this\n",
      "nature. I am well aware that it would be disingenuous to resolve\n",
      "indiscriminately the opposition of any set of men (merely because their\n",
      "situations might subject them to suspicion) into interested or ambitious\n",
      "views. Candor will oblige us to admit that even such men may be actuated\n",
      "by upright intentions; and it cannot be doubted that much of the\n",
      "opposition which has made its appearance, or may hereafter make its\n",
      "appearance, will spring from sources, blameless at least, if not\n",
      "respectable--the honest errors of minds led astray by preconceived\n",
      "jealousies and fears. So numerous indeed and so powerful are the causes\n",
      "which serve to give a false bias to the judgment, that we, upon many\n",
      "occasions, see wise and good men on the wrong as well as on the right\n",
      "side of questions of the first magnitude to society. This circumstance,\n",
      "if duly attended to, would furnish a lesson of moderation to those\n",
      "who are ever so much persuaded of their being in the right in any\n",
      "controversy. And a further reason for caution, in this respect, might\n",
      "be drawn from the reflection that we are not always sure that those\n",
      "who advocate the truth are influenced by purer principles than their\n",
      "antagonists. Ambition, avarice, personal animosity, party opposition,\n",
      "and many other motives not more laudable than these, are apt to operate\n",
      "as well upon those who support as those who oppose the right side of a\n",
      "question. Were there not even these inducements to moderation, nothing\n",
      "could be more ill-judged than that intolerant spirit which has, at all\n",
      "times, characterized political parties. For in politics, as in religion,\n",
      "it is equally absurd to aim at making proselytes by fire and sword.\n",
      "Heresies in either can rarely be cured by persecution.\n",
      "\n",
      "And yet, however just these sentiments will be allowed to be, we have\n",
      "already sufficient indications that it will happen in this as in all\n",
      "former cases of great national discussion. A torrent of angry and\n",
      "malignant passions will be let loose. To judge from the conduct of the\n",
      "opposite parties, we shall be led to conclude that they will mutually\n",
      "hope to evince the justness of their opinions, and to increase the\n",
      "number of their converts by the loudness of their declamations and the\n",
      "bitterness of their invectives. An enlightened zeal for the energy\n",
      "and efficiency of government will be stigmatized as the offspring of a\n",
      "temper fond of despotic power and hostile to the principles of liberty.\n",
      "An over-scrupulous jealousy of danger to the rights of the people,\n",
      "which is more commonly the fault of the head than of the heart, will be\n",
      "represented as mere pretense and artifice, the stale bait for popularity\n",
      "at the expense of the public good. It will be forgotten, on the one\n",
      "hand, that jealousy is the usual concomitant of love, and that the noble\n",
      "enthusiasm of liberty is apt to be infected with a spirit of narrow and\n",
      "illiberal distrust. On the other hand, it will be equally forgotten that\n",
      "the vigor of government is essential to the security of liberty; that,\n",
      "in the contemplation of a sound and well-informed judgment, their\n",
      "interest can never be separated; and that a dangerous ambition more\n",
      "often lurks behind the specious mask of zeal for the rights of the\n",
      "people than under the forbidden appearance of zeal for the firmness and\n",
      "efficiency of government. History will teach us that the former has been\n",
      "found a much more certain road to the introduction of despotism than\n",
      "the latter, and that of those men who have overturned the liberties\n",
      "of republics, the greatest number have begun their career by paying\n",
      "an obsequious court to the people; commencing demagogues, and ending\n",
      "tyrants.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the course of the preceding observations, I have had an eye, my\n",
      "fellow-citizens, to putting you upon your guard against all attempts,\n",
      "from whatever quarter, to influence your decision in a matter of the\n",
      "utmost moment to your welfare, by any impressions other than those which\n",
      "may result from the evidence of truth. You will, no doubt, at the same\n",
      "time, have collected from the general scope of them, that they\n",
      "proceed from a source not unfriendly to the new Constitution. Yes,\n",
      "my countrymen, I own to you that, after having given it an attentive\n",
      "consideration, I am clearly of opinion it is your interest to adopt it.\n",
      "I am convinced that this is the safest course for your liberty, your\n",
      "dignity, and your happiness. I affect not reserves which I do not feel.\n",
      "I will not amuse you with an appearance of deliberation when I have\n",
      "decided. I frankly acknowledge to you my convictions, and I will freely\n",
      "lay before you the reasons on which they are founded. The consciousness\n",
      "of good intentions disdains ambiguity. I shall not, however, multiply\n",
      "professions on this head. My motives must remain in the depository of\n",
      "my own breast. My arguments will be open to all, and may be judged of by\n",
      "all. They shall at least be offered in a spirit which will not disgrace\n",
      "the cause of truth.\n",
      "\n",
      "I propose, in a series of papers, to discuss the following interesting\n",
      "particulars:\n",
      "\n",
      "THE UTILITY OF THE UNION TO YOUR POLITICAL PROSPERITY THE INSUFFICIENCY\n",
      "OF THE PRESENT CONFEDERATION TO PRESERVE THAT UNION THE NECESSITY OF\n",
      "A GOVERNMENT AT LEAST EQUALLY ENERGETIC WITH THE ONE PROPOSED, TO THE\n",
      "ATTAINMENT OF THIS OBJECT THE CONFORMITY OF THE PROPOSED CONSTITUTION\n",
      "TO THE TRUE PRINCIPLES OF REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT ITS ANALOGY TO YOUR\n",
      "OWN STATE CONSTITUTION and lastly, THE ADDITIONAL SECURITY WHICH ITS\n",
      "ADOPTION WILL AFFORD TO THE PRESERVATION OF THAT SPECIES OF GOVERNMENT,\n",
      "TO LIBERTY, AND TO PROPERTY.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the progress of this discussion I shall endeavor to give a\n",
      "satisfactory answer to all the objections which shall have made their\n",
      "appearance, that may seem to have any claim to your attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "It may perhaps be thought superfluous to offer arguments to prove the\n",
      "utility of the UNION, a point, no doubt, deeply engraved on the hearts\n",
      "of the great body of the people in every State, and one, which it may be\n",
      "imagined, has no adversaries. But the fact is, that we already hear\n",
      "it whispered in the private circles of those who oppose the new\n",
      "Constitution, that the thirteen States are of too great extent for\n",
      "any general system, and that we must of necessity resort to separate\n",
      "confederacies of distinct portions of the whole.(1) This doctrine will,\n",
      "in all probability, be gradually propagated, till it has votaries enough\n",
      "to countenance an open avowal of it. For nothing can be more evident,\n",
      "to those who are able to take an enlarged view of the subject, than the\n",
      "alternative of an adoption of the new Constitution or a dismemberment\n",
      "of the Union. It will therefore be of use to begin by examining the\n",
      "advantages of that Union, the certain evils, and the probable dangers,\n",
      "to which every State will be exposed from its dissolution. This shall\n",

      "\n",
      "WHEN the people of America reflect that they are now called upon to\n",
      "decide a question, which, in its consequences, must prove one of the\n",
      "most important that ever engaged their attention, the propriety of their\n",
      "taking a very comprehensive, as well as a very serious, view of it, will\n",
      "be evident.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing is more certain than the indispensable necessity of government,\n",
      "and it is equally undeniable, that whenever and however it is\n",
      "instituted, the people must cede to it some of their natural rights\n",
      "in order to vest it with requisite powers. It is well worthy of\n",
      "consideration therefore, whether it would conduce more to the interest\n",
      "of the people of America that they should, to all general purposes, be\n",
      "one nation, under one federal government, or that they should divide\n",
      "themselves into separate confederacies, and give to the head of each\n",
      "the same kind of powers which they are advised to place in one national\n",
      "government.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has until lately been a received and uncontradicted opinion that the\n",
      "prosperity of the people of America depended on their continuing firmly\n",
      "united, and the wishes, prayers, and efforts of our best and wisest\n",
      "citizens have been constantly directed to that object. But politicians\n",
      "now appear, who insist that this opinion is erroneous, and that instead\n",
      "of looking for safety and happiness in union, we ought to seek it in\n",
      "a division of the States into distinct confederacies or sovereignties.\n",
      "However extraordinary this new doctrine may appear, it nevertheless\n",
      "has its advocates; and certain characters who were much opposed to it\n",
      "formerly, are at present of the number. Whatever may be the arguments\n",
      "or inducements which have wrought this change in the sentiments and\n",
      "declarations of these gentlemen, it certainly would not be wise in the\n",
      "people at large to adopt these new political tenets without being fully\n",
      "convinced that they are founded in truth and sound policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has often given me pleasure to observe that independent America\n",
      "was not composed of detached and distant territories, but that one\n",
      "connected, fertile, wide-spreading country was the portion of our western\n",
      "sons of liberty. Providence has in a particular manner blessed it with\n",
      "a variety of soils and productions, and watered it with innumerable\n",
      "streams, for the delight and accommodation of its inhabitants. A\n",
      "succession of navigable waters forms a kind of chain round its borders,\n",
      "as if to bind it together; while the most noble rivers in the world,\n",
      "running at convenient distances, present them with highways for the\n",
      "easy communication of friendly aids, and the mutual transportation and\n",
      "exchange of their various commodities.\n",
      "\n",
      "With equal pleasure I have as often taken notice that Providence has\n",
      "been pleased to give this one connected country to one united people--a\n",
      "people descended from the same ancestors, speaking the same language,\n",
      "professing the same religion, attached to the same principles of\n",
      "government, very similar in their manners and customs, and who, by their\n",
      "joint counsels, arms, and efforts, fighting side by side throughout\n",
      "a long and bloody war, have nobly established general liberty and\n",
      "independence.\n",
      "\n",
      "This country and this people seem to have been made for each other, and\n",
      "it appears as if it was the design of Providence, that an inheritance\n",
      "so proper and convenient for a band of brethren, united to each other\n",
      "by the strongest ties, should never be split into a number of unsocial,\n",
      "jealous, and alien sovereignties.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similar sentiments have hitherto prevailed among all orders and\n",
      "denominations of men among us. To all general purposes we have uniformly\n",
      "been one people each individual citizen everywhere enjoying the same\n",
      "national rights, privileges, and protection. As a nation we have made\n",
      "peace and war; as a nation we have vanquished our common enemies; as\n",
      "a nation we have formed alliances, and made treaties, and entered into\n",
      "various compacts and conventions with foreign states.\n",
      "\n",
      "A strong sense of the value and blessings of union induced the people,\n",
      "at a very early period, to institute a federal government to preserve\n",
      "and perpetuate it. They formed it almost as soon as they had a political\n",
      "existence; nay, at a time when their habitations were in flames, when\n",
      "many of their citizens were bleeding, and when the progress of hostility\n",
      "and desolation left little room for those calm and mature inquiries\n",
      "and reflections which must ever precede the formation of a wise and\n",
      "well-balanced government for a free people. It is not to be wondered\n",
      "at, that a government instituted in times so inauspicious, should on\n",
      "experiment be found greatly deficient and inadequate to the purpose it\n",
      "was intended to answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "This intelligent people perceived and regretted these defects. Still\n",
      "continuing no less attached to union than enamored of liberty, they\n",
      "observed the danger which immediately threatened the former and more\n",
      "remotely the latter; and being persuaded that ample security for both\n",
      "could only be found in a national government more wisely framed, they\n",
      "as with one voice, convened the late convention at Philadelphia, to take\n",
      "that important subject under consideration.\n",
      "\n",
      "This convention composed of men who possessed the confidence of the\n",
      "people, and many of whom had become highly distinguished by their\n",
      "patriotism, virtue and wisdom, in times which tried the minds and hearts\n",
      "of men, undertook the arduous task. In the mild season of peace, with\n",
      "minds unoccupied by other subjects, they passed many months in cool,\n",
      "uninterrupted, and daily consultation; and finally, without having\n",
      "been awed by power, or influenced by any passions except love for their\n",
      "country, they presented and recommended to the people the plan produced\n",
      "by their joint and very unanimous councils.\n",
      "\n",
      "Admit, for so is the fact, that this plan is only RECOMMENDED, not\n",
      "imposed, yet let it be remembered that it is neither recommended to\n",
      "BLIND approbation, nor to BLIND reprobation; but to that sedate and\n",
      "candid consideration which the magnitude and importance of the subject\n",
      "demand, and which it certainly ought to receive. But this (as was\n",
      "remarked in the foregoing number of this paper) is more to be wished\n",
      "than expected, that it may be so considered and examined. Experience on\n",
      "a former occasion teaches us not to be too sanguine in such hopes. It\n",
      "is not yet forgotten that well-grounded apprehensions of imminent danger\n",
      "induced the people of America to form the memorable Congress of 1774.\n",
      "That body recommended certain measures to their constituents, and the\n",
      "event proved their wisdom; yet it is fresh in our memories how soon the\n",
      "press began to teem with pamphlets and weekly papers against those very\n",
      "measures. Not only many of the officers of government, who obeyed the\n",
      "dictates of personal interest, but others, from a mistaken estimate of\n",
      "consequences, or the undue influence of former attachments, or whose\n",
      "ambition aimed at objects which did not correspond with the public good,\n",
      "were indefatigable in their efforts to persuade the people to reject\n",
      "the advice of that patriotic Congress. Many, indeed, were deceived\n",
      "and deluded, but the great majority of the people reasoned and decided\n",
      "judiciously; and happy they are in reflecting that they did so.\n",
      "\n",
      "They considered that the Congress was composed of many wise and\n",
      "experienced men. That, being convened from different parts of the\n",
      "country, they brought with them and communicated to each other a variety\n",
      "of useful information. That, in the course of the time they passed\n",
      "together in inquiring into and discussing the true interests of their\n",
      "country, they must have acquired very accurate knowledge on that\n",
      "head. That they were individually interested in the public liberty and\n",
      "prosperity, and therefore that it was not less their inclination than\n",
      "their duty to recommend only such measures as, after the most mature\n",
      "deliberation, they really thought prudent and advisable.\n",
      "\n",
      "These and similar considerations then induced the people to rely greatly\n",
      "on the judgment and integrity of the Congress; and they took their\n",
      "advice, notwithstanding the various arts and endeavors used to deter\n",
      "them from it. But if the people at large had reason to confide in the\n",
      "men of that Congress, few of whom had been fully tried or generally\n",
      "known, still greater reason have they now to respect the judgment and\n",
      "advice of the convention, for it is well known that some of the most\n",
      "distinguished members of that Congress, who have been since tried and\n",
      "justly approved for patriotism and abilities, and who have grown old in\n",
      "acquiring political information, were also members of this convention,\n",
      "and carried into it their accumulated knowledge and experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is worthy of remark that not only the first, but every succeeding\n",
      "Congress, as well as the late convention, have invariably joined with\n",
      "the people in thinking that the prosperity of America depended on its\n",
      "Union. To preserve and perpetuate it was the great object of the people\n",
      "in forming that convention, and it is also the great object of the plan\n",
      "which the convention has advised them to adopt. With what propriety,\n",
      "therefore, or for what good purposes, are attempts at this particular\n",
      "period made by some men to depreciate the importance of the Union? Or\n",
      "why is it suggested that three or four confederacies would be better\n",
      "than one? I am persuaded in my own mind that the people have always\n",
      "thought right on this subject, and that their universal and uniform\n",
      "attachment to the cause of the Union rests on great and weighty reasons,\n",
      "which I shall endeavor to develop and explain in some ensuing papers.\n",
      "They who promote the idea of substituting a number of distinct\n",
      "confederacies in the room of the plan of the convention, seem clearly to\n",
      "foresee that the rejection of it would put the continuance of the\n",
      "Union in the utmost jeopardy. That certainly would be the case, and I\n",
      "sincerely wish that it may be as clearly foreseen by every good citizen,\n",
      "that whenever the dissolution of the Union arrives, America will have\n",

      "IT IS not a new observation that the people of any country (if, like\n",
      "the Americans, intelligent and wellinformed) seldom adopt and steadily\n",
      "persevere for many years in an erroneous opinion respecting their\n",
      "interests. That consideration naturally tends to create great respect\n",
      "for the high opinion which the people of America have so long and\n",
      "uniformly entertained of the importance of their continuing firmly\n",
      "united under one federal government, vested with sufficient powers for\n",
      "all general and national purposes.\n",

      "The more attentively I consider and investigate the reasons which appear\n",

      "they are cogent and conclusive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among the many objects to which a wise and free people find it necessary\n",
      "to direct their attention, that of providing for their SAFETY seems to\n",
      "be the first. The SAFETY of the people doubtless has relation to a great\n",
      "variety of circumstances and considerations, and consequently\n",
      "affords great latitude to those who wish to define it precisely and\n",
      "comprehensively.\n",
      "\n",
      "At present I mean only to consider it as it respects security for the\n",
      "preservation of peace and tranquillity, as well as against dangers from\n",
      "FOREIGN ARMS AND INFLUENCE, as from dangers of the LIKE KIND arising\n",
      "from domestic causes. As the former of these comes first in order, it\n",
      "is proper it should be the first discussed. Let us therefore proceed to\n",
      "examine whether the people are not right in their opinion that a cordial\n",
      "Union, under an efficient national government, affords them the best\n",
      "security that can be devised against HOSTILITIES from abroad.\n",
      "\n",
      "The number of wars which have happened or will happen in the world will\n",
      "always be found to be in proportion to the number and weight of the\n",
      "causes, whether REAL or PRETENDED, which PROVOKE or INVITE them. If this\n",
      "remark be just, it becomes useful to inquire whether so many JUST causes\n",
      "of war are likely to be given by UNITED AMERICA as by DISUNITED America;\n",
      "for if it should turn out that United America will probably give the\n",
      "fewest, then it will follow that in this respect the Union tends most to\n",
      "preserve the people in a state of peace with other nations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The JUST causes of war, for the most part, arise either from violation\n",
      "of treaties or from direct violence. America has already formed treaties\n",
      "with no less than six foreign nations, and all of them, except Prussia,\n",
      "are maritime, and therefore able to annoy and injure us. She has also\n",
      "extensive commerce with Portugal, Spain, and Britain, and, with respect\n",
      "to the two latter, has, in addition, the circumstance of neighborhood to\n",
      "attend to.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is of high importance to the peace of America that she observe the\n",
      "laws of nations towards all these powers, and to me it appears evident\n",
      "that this will be more perfectly and punctually done by one national\n",
      "government than it could be either by thirteen separate States or by\n",
      "three or four distinct confederacies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because when once an efficient national government is established, the\n",
      "best men in the country will not only consent to serve, but also will\n",
      "generally be appointed to manage it; for, although town or country,\n",
      "or other contracted influence, may place men in State assemblies,\n",
      "or senates, or courts of justice, or executive departments, yet more\n",
      "general and extensive reputation for talents and other qualifications\n",
      "will be necessary to recommend men to offices under the national\n",
      "government,--especially as it will have the widest field for choice, and\n",
      "never experience that want of proper persons which is not uncommon in\n",
      "some of the States. Hence, it will result that the administration,\n",
      "the political counsels, and the judicial decisions of the national\n",
      "government will be more wise, systematical, and judicious than those of\n",
      "individual States, and consequently more satisfactory with respect to\n",
      "other nations, as well as more SAFE with respect to us.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because, under the national government, treaties and articles of\n",
      "treaties, as well as the laws of nations, will always be expounded in\n",
      "one sense and executed in the same manner,--whereas, adjudications on\n",
      "the same points and questions, in thirteen States, or in three or four\n",
      "confederacies, will not always accord or be consistent; and that, as\n",
      "well from the variety of independent courts and judges appointed by\n",
      "different and independent governments, as from the different local laws\n",
      "and interests which may affect and influence them. The wisdom of\n",
      "the convention, in committing such questions to the jurisdiction and\n",
      "judgment of courts appointed by and responsible only to one national\n",
      "government, cannot be too much commended.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because the prospect of present loss or advantage may often tempt the\n",
      "governing party in one or two States to swerve from good faith and\n",
      "justice; but those temptations, not reaching the other States, and\n",
      "consequently having little or no influence on the national government,\n",
      "the temptation will be fruitless, and good faith and justice be\n",
      "preserved. The case of the treaty of peace with Britain adds great\n",
      "weight to this reasoning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because, even if the governing party in a State should be disposed to\n",
      "resist such temptations, yet as such temptations may, and commonly do,\n",
      "result from circumstances peculiar to the State, and may affect a great\n",
      "number of the inhabitants, the governing party may not always be\n",
      "able, if willing, to prevent the injustice meditated, or to punish the\n",
      "aggressors. But the national government, not being affected by those\n",
      "local circumstances, will neither be induced to commit the wrong\n",
      "themselves, nor want power or inclination to prevent or punish its\n",
      "commission by others.\n",
      "\n",
      "So far, therefore, as either designed or accidental violations of\n",
      "treaties and the laws of nations afford JUST causes of war, they are\n",
      "less to be apprehended under one general government than under several\n",
      "lesser ones, and in that respect the former most favors the SAFETY of\n",
      "the people.\n",
      "\n",
      "As to those just causes of war which proceed from direct and unlawful\n",
      "violence, it appears equally clear to me that one good national\n",
      "government affords vastly more security against dangers of that sort\n",
      "than can be derived from any other quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because such violences are more frequently caused by the passions and\n",
      "interests of a part than of the whole; of one or two States than of the\n",
      "Union. Not a single Indian war has yet been occasioned by aggressions of\n",
      "the present federal government, feeble as it is; but there are several\n",
      "instances of Indian hostilities having been provoked by the improper\n",
      "conduct of individual States, who, either unable or unwilling to\n",
      "restrain or punish offenses, have given occasion to the slaughter of\n",
      "many innocent inhabitants.\n",
      "\n",
      "The neighborhood of Spanish and British territories, bordering on some\n",
      "States and not on others, naturally confines the causes of quarrel more\n",
      "immediately to the borderers. The bordering States, if any, will be\n",
      "those who, under the impulse of sudden irritation, and a quick sense of\n",
      "apparent interest or injury, will be most likely, by direct violence,\n",
      "to excite war with these nations; and nothing can so effectually obviate\n",
      "that danger as a national government, whose wisdom and prudence will\n",
      "not be diminished by the passions which actuate the parties immediately\n",
      "interested.\n",
      "\n",
      "But not only fewer just causes of war will be given by the national\n",
      "government, but it will also be more in their power to accommodate and\n",
      "settle them amicably. They will be more temperate and cool, and in that\n",
      "respect, as well as in others, will be more in capacity to act advisedly\n",
      "than the offending State. The pride of states, as well as of men,\n",
      "naturally disposes them to justify all their actions, and opposes their\n",
      "acknowledging, correcting, or repairing their errors and offenses. The\n",
      "national government, in such cases, will not be affected by this pride,\n",
      "but will proceed with moderation and candor to consider and decide on\n",
      "the means most proper to extricate them from the difficulties which\n",
      "threaten them.\n",

      "Besides, it is well known that acknowledgments, explanations, and\n",

      "thrown would have frequent and violent contests with each other. To\n",
      "presume a want of motives for such contests as an argument against their\n",
      "existence, would be to forget that men are ambitious, vindictive, and\n",
      "rapacious. To look for a continuation of harmony between a number of\n",
      "independent, unconnected sovereignties in the same neighborhood, would\n",
      "be to disregard the uniform course of human events, and to set at\n",
      "defiance the accumulated experience of ages.\n",

      "The causes of hostility among nations are innumerable. There are some\n",
      "which have a general and almost constant operation upon the collective\n",
      "bodies of society. Of this description are the love of power or the\n",
      "desire of pre-eminence and dominion--the jealousy of power, or the\n",
      "desire of equality and safety. There are others which have a more\n",
      "circumscribed though an equally operative influence within their\n",
      "spheres. Such are the rivalships and competitions of commerce between\n",
      "commercial nations. And there are others, not less numerous than either\n",
      "of the former, which take their origin entirely in private passions;\n",
      "in the attachments, enmities, interests, hopes, and fears of leading\n",

      "inducements which have, at different times, deluged in blood all the\n",
      "nations in the world. But, unfortunately for us, the question admits\n",
      "of a more particular answer. There are causes of differences within\n",
      "our immediate contemplation, of the tendency of which, even under the\n",
      "restraints of a federal constitution, we have had sufficient experience\n",

      "Territorial disputes have at all times been found one of the most\n",
      "fertile sources of hostility among nations. Perhaps the greatest\n",
      "proportion of wars that have desolated the earth have sprung from this\n",
      "origin. This cause would exist among us in full force. We have a vast\n",
      "tract of unsettled territory within the boundaries of the United States.\n",
      "There still are discordant and undecided claims between several of them,\n",
      "and the dissolution of the Union would lay a foundation for similar\n",
      "claims between them all. It is well known that they have heretofore had\n",
      "serious and animated discussion concerning the rights to the lands which\n",
      "were ungranted at the time of the Revolution, and which usually went\n",
      "under the name of crown lands. The States within the limits of whose\n",
      "colonial governments they were comprised have claimed them as their\n",
      "property, the others have contended that the rights of the crown in this\n",
      "article devolved upon the Union; especially as to all that part of the\n",
      "Western territory which, either by actual possession, or through the\n",
      "submission of the Indian proprietors, was subjected to the jurisdiction\n",
      "of the king of Great Britain, till it was relinquished in the treaty of\n",
      "peace. This, it has been said, was at all events an acquisition to the\n",
      "Confederacy by compact with a foreign power. It has been the prudent\n",
      "policy of Congress to appease this controversy, by prevailing upon the\n",
      "States to make cessions to the United States for the benefit of the\n",
      "whole. This has been so far accomplished as, under a continuation of the\n",
      "Union, to afford a decided prospect of an amicable termination of the\n",
      "dispute. A dismemberment of the Confederacy, however, would revive this\n",
      "dispute, and would create others on the same subject. At present, a\n",
      "large part of the vacant Western territory is, by cession at least, if\n",
      "not by any anterior right, the common property of the Union. If that\n",
      "were at an end, the States which made the cession, on a principle\n",
      "of federal compromise, would be apt when the motive of the grant had\n",
      "ceased, to reclaim the lands as a reversion. The other States would no\n",
      "doubt insist on a proportion, by right of representation. Their argument\n",
      "would be, that a grant, once made, could not be revoked; and that the\n",
      "justice of participating in territory acquired or secured by the joint\n",
      "efforts of the Confederacy, remained undiminished. If, contrary to\n",
      "probability, it should be admitted by all the States, that each had a\n",
      "right to a share of this common stock, there would still be a difficulty\n",
      "to be surmounted, as to a proper rule of apportionment. Different\n",
      "principles would be set up by different States for this purpose; and as\n",

      "the future, we shall have good ground to apprehend, that the sword\n",
      "would sometimes be appealed to as the arbiter of their differences.\n",
      "The circumstances of the dispute between Connecticut and Pennsylvania,\n",
      "respecting the land at Wyoming, admonish us not to be sanguine in\n",
      "expecting an easy accommodation of such differences. The articles of\n",
      "confederation obliged the parties to submit the matter to the decision\n",
      "of a federal court. The submission was made, and the court decided\n",
      "in favor of Pennsylvania. But Connecticut gave strong indications\n",
      "of dissatisfaction with that determination; nor did she appear to be\n",
      "entirely resigned to it, till, by negotiation and management, something\n",
      "like an equivalent was found for the loss she supposed herself to have\n",
      "sustained. Nothing here said is intended to convey the slightest censure\n",
      "on the conduct of that State. She no doubt sincerely believed herself\n",

      "in the claim; and can attest the danger to which the peace of the\n",
      "Confederacy might have been exposed, had this State attempted to assert\n",
      "its rights by force. Two motives preponderated in that opposition: one,\n",
      "a jealousy entertained of our future power; and the other, the interest\n",

      "obtained grants of lands under the actual government of that district.\n",
      "Even the States which brought forward claims, in contradiction to ours,\n",
      "seemed more solicitous to dismember this State, than to establish\n",
      "their own pretensions. These were New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and\n",
      "Connecticut. New Jersey and Rhode Island, upon all occasions, discovered\n",
      "a warm zeal for the independence of Vermont; and Maryland, till alarmed\n",
      "by the appearance of a connection between Canada and that State, entered\n",
      "deeply into the same views. These being small States, saw with an\n",
      "unfriendly eye the perspective of our growing greatness. In a review of\n",
      "these transactions we may trace some of the causes which would be\n",

      "in the advantages of their more fortunate neighbors. Each State,\n",
      "or separate confederacy, would pursue a system of commercial policy\n",
      "peculiar to itself. This would occasion distinctions, preferences, and\n",
      "exclusions, which would beget discontent. The habits of intercourse, on\n",
      "the basis of equal privileges, to which we have been accustomed since\n",
      "the earliest settlement of the country, would give a keener edge to\n",
      "those causes of discontent than they would naturally have independent\n",

      "SOVEREIGNTIES CONSULTING A DISTINCT INTEREST. The spirit of enterprise,\n",
      "which characterizes the commercial part of America, has left no occasion\n",
      "of displaying itself unimproved. It is not at all probable that this\n",
      "unbridled spirit would pay much respect to those regulations of trade by\n",
      "which particular States might endeavor to secure exclusive benefits to\n",
      "their own citizens. The infractions of these regulations, on one side,\n",

      "submitted to by the tributary States. The relative situation of New\n",
      "York, Connecticut, and New Jersey would afford an example of this\n",
      "kind. New York, from the necessities of revenue, must lay duties on\n",
      "her importations. A great part of these duties must be paid by the\n",
      "inhabitants of the two other States in the capacity of consumers of what\n",

      "advantage. Her citizens would not consent that a duty paid by them\n",
      "should be remitted in favor of the citizens of her neighbors; nor would\n",
      "it be practicable, if there were not this impediment in the way, to\n",
      "distinguish the customers in our own markets. Would Connecticut and New\n",
      "Jersey long submit to be taxed by New York for her exclusive benefit?\n",
      "Should we be long permitted to remain in the quiet and undisturbed\n",
      "enjoyment of a metropolis, from the possession of which we derived\n",
      "an advantage so odious to our neighbors, and, in their opinion, so\n",
      "oppressive? Should we be able to preserve it against the incumbent\n",
      "weight of Connecticut on the one side, and the co-operating pressure of\n",

      "The public debt of the Union would be a further cause of collision\n",
      "between the separate States or confederacies. The apportionment, in the\n",

      "alike productive of ill-humor and animosity. How would it be possible\n",
      "to agree upon a rule of apportionment satisfactory to all? There is\n",
      "scarcely any that can be proposed which is entirely free from real\n",

      "States as to the general principle of discharging the public debt. Some\n",
      "of them, either less impressed with the importance of national credit,\n",
      "or because their citizens have little, if any, immediate interest in the\n",
      "question, feel an indifference, if not a repugnance, to the payment of\n",
      "the domestic debt at any rate. These would be inclined to magnify the\n",
      "difficulties of a distribution. Others of them, a numerous body of whose\n",
      "citizens are creditors to the public beyond proportion of the State\n",
      "in the total amount of the national debt, would be strenuous for some\n",
      "equitable and effective provision. The procrastinations of the former\n",
      "would excite the resentments of the latter. The settlement of a rule\n",
      "would, in the meantime, be postponed by real differences of opinion and\n",
      "affected delays. The citizens of the States interested would clamour;\n",

      "of external invasion and internal contention.\n",

      "Suppose the difficulties of agreeing upon a rule surmounted, and the\n",
      "apportionment made. Still there is great room to suppose that the rule\n",
      "agreed upon would, upon experiment, be found to bear harder upon\n",
      "some States than upon others. Those which were sufferers by it would\n",
      "naturally seek for a mitigation of the burden. The others would as\n",
      "naturally be disinclined to a revision, which was likely to end in an\n",
      "increase of their own incumbrances. Their refusal would be too plausible\n",
      "a pretext to the complaining States to withhold their contributions, not\n",
      "to be embraced with avidity; and the non-compliance of these States\n",
      "with their engagements would be a ground of bitter discussion and\n",
      "altercation. If even the rule adopted should in practice justify the\n",
      "equality of its principle, still delinquencies in payments on the part\n",
      "of some of the States would result from a diversity of other causes--the\n",
      "real deficiency of resources; the mismanagement of their finances;\n",
      "accidental disorders in the management of the government; and, in\n",
      "addition to the rest, the reluctance with which men commonly part with\n",

      "tranquillity of nations than their being bound to mutual contributions\n",
      "for any common object that does not yield an equal and coincident\n",

      "in case of disunion, or such combinations of them as might happen to be\n",
      "formed out of the wreck of the general Confederacy, would be subject to\n",

      "united under one government, let us enter into a concise detail of some\n",
      "of the consequences that would attend such a situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "War between the States, in the first period of their separate existence,\n",
      "would be accompanied with much greater distresses than it commonly is\n",
      "in those countries where regular military establishments have long\n",
      "obtained. The disciplined armies always kept on foot on the continent\n",
      "of Europe, though they bear a malignant aspect to liberty and economy,\n",
      "have, notwithstanding, been productive of the signal advantage of\n",
      "rendering sudden conquests impracticable, and of preventing that\n",
      "rapid desolation which used to mark the progress of war prior to their\n",
      "introduction. The art of fortification has contributed to the same ends.\n",
      "The nations of Europe are encircled with chains of fortified places,\n",
      "which mutually obstruct invasion. Campaigns are wasted in reducing two\n",
      "or three frontier garrisons, to gain admittance into an enemy's country.\n",
      "Similar impediments occur at every step, to exhaust the strength and\n",
      "delay the progress of an invader. Formerly, an invading army would\n",
      "penetrate into the heart of a neighboring country almost as soon as\n",
      "intelligence of its approach could be received; but now a comparatively\n",
      "small force of disciplined troops, acting on the defensive, with the aid\n",
      "of posts, is able to impede, and finally to frustrate, the enterprises\n",
      "of one much more considerable. The history of war, in that quarter\n",
      "of the globe, is no longer a history of nations subdued and empires\n",
      "overturned, but of towns taken and retaken; of battles that decide\n",
      "nothing; of retreats more beneficial than victories; of much effort and\n",
      "little acquisition.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this country the scene would be altogether reversed. The jealousy\n",
      "of military establishments would postpone them as long as possible.\n",
      "The want of fortifications, leaving the frontiers of one state open\n",
      "to another, would facilitate inroads. The populous States would, with\n",
      "little difficulty, overrun their less populous neighbors. Conquests\n",
      "would be as easy to be made as difficult to be retained. War, therefore,\n",
      "would be desultory and predatory. PLUNDER and devastation ever march in\n",
      "the train of irregulars. The calamities of individuals would make the\n",

      "\n",
      "This picture is not too highly wrought; though, I confess, it would not\n",
      "long remain a just one. Safety from external danger is the most powerful\n",
      "director of national conduct. Even the ardent love of liberty will,\n",
      "after a time, give way to its dictates. The violent destruction of life\n",
      "and property incident to war, the continual effort and alarm attendant\n",
      "on a state of continual danger, will compel nations the most attached to\n",
      "liberty to resort for repose and security to institutions which have a\n",
      "tendency to destroy their civil and political rights. To be more safe,\n",
      "they at length become willing to run the risk of being less free.\n",
      "\n",
      "The institutions chiefly alluded to are STANDING ARMIES and the\n",
      "correspondent appendages of military establishments. Standing armies,\n",
      "it is said, are not provided against in the new Constitution; and it\n",
      "is therefore inferred that they may exist under it.(1) Their existence,\n",
      "however, from the very terms of the proposition, is, at most,\n",
      "problematical and uncertain. But standing armies, it may be replied,\n",
      "must inevitably result from a dissolution of the Confederacy. Frequent\n",
      "war and constant apprehension, which require a state of as constant\n",
      "preparation, will infallibly produce them. The weaker States or\n",
      "confederacies would first have recourse to them, to put themselves upon\n",
      "an equality with their more potent neighbors. They would endeavor to\n",
      "supply the inferiority of population and resources by a more regular\n",
      "and effective system of defense, by disciplined troops, and by\n",
      "fortifications. They would, at the same time, be necessitated to\n",
      "strengthen the executive arm of government, in doing which their\n",
      "constitutions would acquire a progressive direction toward monarchy. It\n",
      "is of the nature of war to increase the executive at the expense of the\n",
      "legislative authority.\n",

      "Small states, or states of less natural strength, under vigorous\n",
      "governments, and with the assistance of disciplined armies, have often\n",
      "triumphed over large states, or states of greater natural strength,\n",
      "which have been destitute of these advantages. Neither the pride nor the\n",
      "safety of the more important States or confederacies would permit them\n",
      "long to submit to this mortifying and adventitious superiority. They\n",
      "would quickly resort to means similar to those by which it had been\n",
      "effected, to reinstate themselves in their lost pre-eminence. Thus, we\n",
      "should, in a little time, see established in every part of this country\n",
      "the same engines of despotism which have been the scourge of the Old\n",
      "World. This, at least, would be the natural course of things; and our\n",
      "reasonings will be the more likely to be just, in proportion as they are\n",
      "accommodated to this standard.\n",

      "human affairs.\n",

      "It may, perhaps, be asked, by way of objection to this, why did\n",
      "not standing armies spring up out of the contentions which so often\n",
      "distracted the ancient republics of Greece? Different answers, equally\n",
      "satisfactory, may be given to this question. The industrious habits of\n",
      "the people of the present day, absorbed in the pursuits of gain,\n",
      "and devoted to the improvements of agriculture and commerce, are\n",
      "incompatible with the condition of a nation of soldiers, which was the\n",
      "true condition of the people of those republics. The means of revenue,\n",
      "which have been so greatly multiplied by the increase of gold and silver\n",
      "and of the arts of industry, and the science of finance, which is the\n",
      "offspring of modern times, concurring with the habits of nations, have\n",
      "produced an entire revolution in the system of war, and have rendered\n",
      "disciplined armies, distinct from the body of the citizens, the\n",
      "inseparable companions of frequent hostility.\n",

      "There is a wide difference, also, between military establishments in a\n",
      "country seldom exposed by its situation to internal invasions, and in\n",
      "one which is often subject to them, and always apprehensive of them.\n",
      "The rulers of the former can have no good pretext, if they are even so\n",
      "inclined, to keep on foot armies so numerous as must of necessity be\n",
      "maintained in the latter. These armies being, in the first case, rarely,\n",
      "if at all, called into activity for interior defense, the people are in\n",
      "no danger of being broken to military subordination. The laws are not\n",
      "accustomed to relaxations, in favor of military exigencies; the civil\n",
      "state remains in full vigor, neither corrupted, nor confounded with the\n",
      "principles or propensities of the other state. The smallness of the army\n",
      "renders the natural strength of the community an overmatch for it;\n",
      "and the citizens, not habituated to look up to the military power for\n",
      "protection, or to submit to its oppressions, neither love nor fear the\n",
      "soldiery; they view them with a spirit of jealous acquiescence in a\n",
      "necessary evil, and stand ready to resist a power which they suppose may\n",

      "\n",
      "The army under such circumstances may usefully aid the magistrate to\n",

      "of government, have erroneously supposed that by reducing mankind to\n",
      "a perfect equality in their political rights, they would, at the same\n",

      "varies from pure democracy, and we shall comprehend both the nature of\n",
      "the cure and the efficacy which it must derive from the Union.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two great points of difference between a democracy and a republic\n",
      "are: first, the delegation of the government, in the latter, to a small\n",

      "citizens, and greater sphere of country, over which the latter may be\n",
      "extended.\n",
      "\n",
      "The effect of the first difference is, on the one hand, to refine and\n",
      "enlarge the public views, by passing them through the medium of a chosen\n",
      "body of citizens, whose wisdom may best discern the true interest of\n",
      "their country, and whose patriotism and love of justice will be least\n",
      "likely to sacrifice it to temporary or partial considerations. Under\n",
      "such a regulation, it may well happen that the public voice, pronounced\n",
      "by the representatives of the people, will be more consonant to the\n",
      "public good than if pronounced by the people themselves, convened for\n",
      "the purpose. On the other hand, the effect may be inverted. Men of\n",
      "factious tempers, of local prejudices, or of sinister designs, may, by\n",
      "intrigue, by corruption, or by other means, first obtain the suffrages,\n",
      "and then betray the interests, of the people. The question resulting is,\n",
      "whether small or extensive republics are more favorable to the election\n",
      "of proper guardians of the public weal; and it is clearly decided in\n",
      "favor of the latter by two obvious considerations:\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first place, it is to be remarked that, however small the\n",
      "republic may be, the representatives must be raised to a certain number,\n",
      "in order to guard against the cabals of a few; and that, however large\n",
      "it may be, they must be limited to a certain number, in order to\n",
      "guard against the confusion of a multitude. Hence, the number of\n",
      "representatives in the two cases not being in proportion to that of\n",
      "the two constituents, and being proportionally greater in the small\n",
      "republic, it follows that, if the proportion of fit characters be not\n",
      "less in the large than in the small republic, the former will present a\n",
      "greater option, and consequently a greater probability of a fit choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the next place, as each representative will be chosen by a greater\n",
      "number of citizens in the large than in the small republic, it will\n",
      "be more difficult for unworthy candidates to practice with success the\n",
      "vicious arts by which elections are too often carried; and the suffrages\n",
      "of the people being more free, will be more likely to centre in men who\n",
      "possess the most attractive merit and the most diffusive and established\n",
      "characters.\n",
      "\n",
      "It must be confessed that in this, as in most other cases, there is a\n",
      "mean, on both sides of which inconveniences will be found to lie.\n",
      "By enlarging too much the number of electors, you render the\n",
      "representatives too little acquainted with all their local circumstances\n",
      "and lesser interests; as by reducing it too much, you render him unduly\n",
      "attached to these, and too little fit to comprehend and pursue great and\n",
      "national objects. The federal Constitution forms a happy combination in\n",
      "this respect; the great and aggregate interests being referred to the\n",
      "national, the local and particular to the State legislatures.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other point of difference is, the greater number of citizens\n",
      "and extent of territory which may be brought within the compass of\n",
      "republican than of democratic government; and it is this circumstance\n",
      "principally which renders factious combinations less to be dreaded\n",
      "in the former than in the latter. The smaller the society, the fewer\n",
      "probably will be the distinct parties and interests composing it; the\n",
      "fewer the distinct parties and interests, the more frequently will\n",
      "a majority be found of the same party; and the smaller the number of\n",
      "individuals composing a majority, and the smaller the compass within\n",
      "which they are placed, the more easily will they concert and execute\n",
      "their plans of oppression. Extend the sphere, and you take in a greater\n",
      "variety of parties and interests; you make it less probable that a\n",
      "majority of the whole will have a common motive to invade the rights\n",
      "of other citizens; or if such a common motive exists, it will be more\n",
      "difficult for all who feel it to discover their own strength, and to act\n",
      "in unison with each other. Besides other impediments, it may be remarked\n",
      "that, where there is a consciousness of unjust or dishonorable purposes,\n",
      "communication is always checked by distrust in proportion to the number\n",
      "whose concurrence is necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence, it clearly appears, that the same advantage which a republic has\n",
      "over a democracy, in controlling the effects of faction, is enjoyed by\n",
      "a large over a small republic,--is enjoyed by the Union over the\n",
      "States composing it. Does the advantage consist in the substitution of\n",
      "representatives whose enlightened views and virtuous sentiments render\n",
      "them superior to local prejudices and schemes of injustice? It will not\n",
      "be denied that the representation of the Union will be most likely\n",
      "to possess these requisite endowments. Does it consist in the greater\n",
      "security afforded by a greater variety of parties, against the event of\n",
      "any one party being able to outnumber and oppress the rest? In an equal\n",
      "degree does the increased variety of parties comprised within the\n",
      "Union, increase this security. Does it, in fine, consist in the greater\n",
      "obstacles opposed to the concert and accomplishment of the secret wishes\n",
      "of an unjust and interested majority? Here, again, the extent of the\n",
      "Union gives it the most palpable advantage.\n",
      "\n",
      "The influence of factious leaders may kindle a flame within their\n",
      "particular States, but will be unable to spread a general conflagration\n",
      "through the other States. A religious sect may degenerate into a\n",
      "political faction in a part of the Confederacy; but the variety of sects\n",
      "dispersed over the entire face of it must secure the national councils\n",
      "against any danger from that source. A rage for paper money, for an\n",
      "abolition of debts, for an equal division of property, or for any other\n",
      "improper or wicked project, will be less apt to pervade the whole body\n",

      "foreign countries, laden with valuable cargoes, would rarely choose to\n",

      "after as before their arrival at the places of their final destination.\n",

      "vessels, judiciously stationed at the entrances of our ports, might at\n",
      "a small expense be made useful sentinels of the laws. And the government\n",
      "having the same interest to provide against violations everywhere,\n",
      "the co-operation of its measures in each State would have a powerful\n",
      "tendency to render them effectual. Here also we should preserve by\n",
      "Union, an advantage which nature holds out to us, and which would be\n",
      "relinquished by separation. The United States lie at a great distance\n",
      "from Europe, and at a considerable distance from all other places\n",
      "with which they would have extensive connections of foreign trade.\n",
      "The passage from them to us, in a few hours, or in a single night,\n",
      "as between the coasts of France and Britain, and of other neighboring\n",
      "nations, would be impracticable. This is a prodigious security against a\n",
      "direct contraband with foreign countries; but a circuitous contraband to\n",
      "one State, through the medium of another, would be both easy and safe.\n",

      "It is therefore evident, that one national government would be able, at\n",
      "much less expense, to extend the duties on imports, beyond comparison,\n",
      "further than would be practicable to the States separately, or to any\n",
      "partial confederacies. Hitherto, I believe, it may safely be asserted,\n",
      "that these duties have not upon an average exceeded in any State three\n",
      "per cent. In France they are estimated to be about fifteen per cent.,\n",
      "and in Britain they exceed this proportion.(1) There seems to be nothing\n",
      "to hinder their being increased in this country to at least treble their\n",
      "present amount. The single article of ardent spirits, under federal\n",
      "regulation, might be made to furnish a considerable revenue. Upon a\n",
      "ratio to the importation into this State, the whole quantity imported\n",
      "into the United States may be estimated at four millions of gallons;\n",
      "which, at a shilling per gallon, would produce two hundred thousand\n",
      "pounds. That article would well bear this rate of duty; and if it should\n",
      "tend to diminish the consumption of it, such an effect would be equally\n",
      "favorable to the agriculture, to the economy, to the morals, and to the\n",
      "health of the society. There is, perhaps, nothing so much a subject of\n",
      "national extravagance as these spirits.\n",
      "\n",
      "What will be the consequence, if we are not able to avail ourselves of\n",
      "the resource in question in its full extent? A nation cannot long exist\n",
      "without revenues. Destitute of this essential support, it must resign\n",
      "its independence, and sink into the degraded condition of a province.\n",
      "This is an extremity to which no government will of choice accede.\n",
      "Revenue, therefore, must be had at all events. In this country, if the\n",
      "principal part be not drawn from commerce, it must fall with oppressive\n",
      "weight upon land. It has been already intimated that excises, in their\n",
      "true signification, are too little in unison with the feelings of the\n",
      "people, to admit of great use being made of that mode of taxation; nor,\n",
      "indeed, in the States where almost the sole employment is agriculture,\n",
      "are the objects proper for excise sufficiently numerous to permit very\n",
      "ample collections in that way. Personal estate (as has been before\n",
      "remarked), from the difficulty in tracing it, cannot be subjected to\n",
      "large contributions, by any other means than by taxes on consumption. In\n",
      "populous cities, it may be enough the subject of conjecture, to occasion\n",
      "the oppression of individuals, without much aggregate benefit to the\n",
      "State; but beyond these circles, it must, in a great measure, escape the\n",
      "eye and the hand of the tax-gatherer. As the necessities of the State,\n",
      "nevertheless, must be satisfied in some mode or other, the defect of\n",
      "other resources must throw the principal weight of public burdens on\n",
      "the possessors of land. And as, on the other hand, the wants of the\n",
      "government can never obtain an adequate supply, unless all the sources\n",
      "of revenue are open to its demands, the finances of the community, under\n",
      "such embarrassments, cannot be put into a situation consistent with\n",
      "its respectability or its security. Thus we shall not even have the\n",
      "consolations of a full treasury, to atone for the oppression of that\n",
      "valuable class of the citizens who are employed in the cultivation of\n",
      "the soil. But public and private distress will keep pace with each\n",

      "to be the carriers as well as the purchasers of their commodities.\n",
      "Pennsylvania may not choose to confound her interests in a connection so\n",
      "adverse to her policy. As she must at all events be a frontier, she may\n",
      "deem it most consistent with her safety to have her exposed side turned\n",

      "difficulties, the want of those solid objections which they endeavor in\n",
      "vain to find.\n",
      "\n",
      "The error which limits republican government to a narrow district has\n",
      "been unfolded and refuted in preceding papers. I remark here only that\n",
      "it seems to owe its rise and prevalence chiefly to the confounding of a\n",
      "republic with a democracy, applying to the former reasonings drawn from\n",
      "the nature of the latter. The true distinction between these forms was\n",
      "also adverted to on a former occasion. It is, that in a democracy, the\n",

      "To this accidental source of the error may be added the artifice of some\n",
      "celebrated authors, whose writings have had a great share in forming\n",
      "the modern standard of political opinions. Being subjects either of\n",
      "an absolute or limited monarchy, they have endeavored to heighten\n",
      "the advantages, or palliate the evils of those forms, by placing in\n",
      "comparison the vices and defects of the republican, and by citing as\n",
      "specimens of the latter the turbulent democracies of ancient Greece and\n",
      "modern Italy. Under the confusion of names, it has been an easy task to\n",
      "transfer to a republic observations applicable to a democracy only; and\n",
      "among others, the observation that it can never be established but among\n",
      "a small number of people, living within a small compass of territory.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such a fallacy may have been the less perceived, as most of the popular\n",
      "governments of antiquity were of the democratic species; and even in\n",
      "modern Europe, to which we owe the great principle of representation, no\n",
      "example is seen of a government wholly popular, and founded, at the same\n",
      "time, wholly on that principle. If Europe has the merit of discovering\n",
      "this great mechanical power in government, by the simple agency of which\n",
      "the will of the largest political body may be concentred, and its force\n",
      "directed to any object which the public good requires, America can claim\n",
      "the merit of making the discovery the basis of unmixed and extensive\n",

      "As the natural limit of a democracy is that distance from the central\n",
      "point which will just permit the most remote citizens to assemble as\n",
      "often as their public functions demand, and will include no greater\n",
      "number than can join in those functions; so the natural limit of a\n",
      "republic is that distance from the centre which will barely allow\n",
      "the representatives to meet as often as may be necessary for the\n",
      "administration of public affairs. Can it be said that the limits of the\n",
      "United States exceed this distance? It will not be said by those who\n",
      "recollect that the Atlantic coast is the longest side of the Union, that\n",
      "during the term of thirteen years, the representatives of the States\n",
      "have been almost continually assembled, and that the members from the\n",
      "most distant States are not chargeable with greater intermissions of\n",
      "attendance than those from the States in the neighborhood of Congress.\n",
      "\n",
      "That we may form a juster estimate with regard to this interesting\n",
      "subject, let us resort to the actual dimensions of the Union. The\n",
      "limits, as fixed by the treaty of peace, are: on the east the Atlantic,\n",
      "on the south the latitude of thirty-one degrees, on the west the\n",
      "Mississippi, and on the north an irregular line running in some\n",
      "instances beyond the forty-fifth degree, in others falling as low as the\n",
      "forty-second. The southern shore of Lake Erie lies below that latitude.\n",
      "Computing the distance between the thirty-first and forty-fifth degrees,\n",
      "it amounts to nine hundred and seventy-three common miles; computing it\n",
      "from thirty-one to forty-two degrees, to seven hundred and sixty-four\n",
      "miles and a half. Taking the mean for the distance, the amount will be\n",
      "eight hundred and sixty-eight miles and three-fourths. The mean distance\n",
      "from the Atlantic to the Mississippi does not probably exceed seven\n",
      "hundred and fifty miles. On a comparison of this extent with that of\n",
      "several countries in Europe, the practicability of rendering our system\n",
      "commensurate to it appears to be demonstrable. It is not a great deal\n",
      "larger than Germany, where a diet representing the whole empire is\n",
      "continually assembled; or than Poland before the late dismemberment,\n",
      "where another national diet was the depositary of the supreme power.\n",
      "Passing by France and Spain, we find that in Great Britain, inferior as\n",
      "it may be in size, the representatives of the northern extremity of the\n",
      "island have as far to travel to the national council as will be required\n",
      "of those of the most remote parts of the Union.\n",
      "\n",
      "Favorable as this view of the subject may be, some observations remain\n",
      "which will place it in a light still more satisfactory.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first place it is to be remembered that the general government is\n",
      "not to be charged with the whole power of making and administering laws.\n",
      "Its jurisdiction is limited to certain enumerated objects, which concern\n",
      "all the members of the republic, but which are not to be attained by\n",
      "the separate provisions of any. The subordinate governments, which can\n",
      "extend their care to all those other subjects which can be separately\n",
      "provided for, will retain their due authority and activity. Were it\n",
      "proposed by the plan of the convention to abolish the governments of\n",
      "the particular States, its adversaries would have some ground for their\n",
      "objection; though it would not be difficult to show that if they were\n",
      "abolished the general government would be compelled, by the principle of\n",
      "self-preservation, to reinstate them in their proper jurisdiction.\n",
      "\n",
      "A second observation to be made is that the immediate object of the\n",
      "federal Constitution is to secure the union of the thirteen primitive\n",
      "States, which we know to be practicable; and to add to them such other\n",
      "States as may arise in their own bosoms, or in their neighborhoods,\n",
      "which we cannot doubt to be equally practicable. The arrangements that\n",
      "may be necessary for those angles and fractions of our territory which\n",
      "lie on our northwestern frontier, must be left to those whom further\n",
      "discoveries and experience will render more equal to the task.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let it be remarked, in the third place, that the intercourse throughout\n",
      "the Union will be facilitated by new improvements. Roads will everywhere\n",
      "be shortened, and kept in better order; accommodations for travelers\n",
      "will be multiplied and meliorated; an interior navigation on our eastern\n",
      "side will be opened throughout, or nearly throughout, the whole extent\n",
      "of the thirteen States. The communication between the Western and\n",
      "Atlantic districts, and between different parts of each, will be\n",
      "rendered more and more easy by those numerous canals with which the\n",
      "beneficence of nature has intersected our country, and which art finds\n",
      "it so little difficult to connect and complete.\n",
      "\n",
      "A fourth and still more important consideration is, that as almost every\n",
      "State will, on one side or other, be a frontier, and will thus find, in\n",
      "regard to its safety, an inducement to make some sacrifices for the\n",
      "sake of the general protection; so the States which lie at the greatest\n",
      "distance from the heart of the Union, and which, of course, may partake\n",
      "least of the ordinary circulation of its benefits, will be at the same\n",
      "time immediately contiguous to foreign nations, and will consequently\n",
      "stand, on particular occasions, in greatest need of its strength and\n",
      "resources. It may be inconvenient for Georgia, or the States forming our\n",
      "western or northeastern borders, to send their representatives to the\n",
      "seat of government; but they would find it more so to struggle alone\n",
      "against an invading enemy, or even to support alone the whole expense of\n",
      "those precautions which may be dictated by the neighborhood of continual\n",
      "danger. If they should derive less benefit, therefore, from the Union\n",
      "in some respects than the less distant States, they will derive greater\n",
      "benefit from it in other respects, and thus the proper equilibrium will\n",
      "be maintained throughout.\n",
      "\n",
      "I submit to you, my fellow-citizens, these considerations, in full\n",
      "confidence that the good sense which has so often marked your decisions\n",
      "will allow them their due weight and effect; and that you will never\n",
      "suffer difficulties, however formidable in appearance, or however\n",
      "fashionable the error on which they may be founded, to drive you into\n",

      "of affection, can no longer live together as members of the same family;\n",
      "can no longer continue the mutual guardians of their mutual happiness;\n",
      "can no longer be fellow citizens of one great, respectable, and\n",
      "flourishing empire. Hearken not to the voice which petulantly tells you\n",

      "of their becoming aliens, rivals, enemies. And if novelties are to be\n",
      "shunned, believe me, the most alarming of all novelties, the most wild\n",
      "of all projects, the most rash of all attempts, is that of rendering us\n",

      "spirit, posterity will be indebted for the possession, and the world\n",

      "THE tendency of the principle of legislation for States, or communities,\n",
      "in their political capacities, as it has been exemplified by the\n",
      "experiment we have made of it, is equally attested by the events which\n",
      "have befallen all other governments of the confederate kind, of which\n",
      "we have any account, in exact proportion to its prevalence in those\n",
      "systems. The confirmations of this fact will be worthy of a distinct\n",
      "and particular examination. I shall content myself with barely observing\n",
      "here, that of all the confederacies of antiquity, which history has\n",
      "handed down to us, the Lycian and Achaean leagues, as far as there\n",
      "remain vestiges of them, appear to have been most free from the fetters\n",
      "of that mistaken principle, and were accordingly those which have best\n",
      "deserved, and have most liberally received, the applauding suffrages of\n",
      "political writers.\n",
      "\n",
      "This exceptionable principle may, as truly as emphatically, be styled\n",
      "the parent of anarchy: It has been seen that delinquencies in the\n",
      "members of the Union are its natural and necessary offspring; and that\n",
      "whenever they happen, the only constitutional remedy is force, and the\n",
      "immediate effect of the use of it, civil war.\n",
      "\n",
      "It remains to inquire how far so odious an engine of government, in its\n",
      "application to us, would even be capable of answering its end. If there\n",
      "should not be a large army constantly at the disposal of the national\n",
      "government it would either not be able to employ force at all, or,\n",
      "when this could be done, it would amount to a war between parts of\n",

      "strongest combination would be most likely to prevail, whether it\n",
      "consisted of those who supported or of those who resisted the general\n",
      "authority. It would rarely happen that the delinquency to be redressed\n",
      "would be confined to a single member, and if there were more than one\n",
      "who had neglected their duty, similarity of situation would induce them\n",
      "to unite for common defense. Independent of this motive of sympathy, if\n",
      "a large and influential State should happen to be the aggressing member,\n",
      "it would commonly have weight enough with its neighbors to win over some\n",
      "of them as associates to its cause. Specious arguments of danger to\n",
      "the common liberty could easily be contrived; plausible excuses for\n",
      "the deficiencies of the party could, without difficulty, be invented\n",
      "to alarm the apprehensions, inflame the passions, and conciliate the\n",
      "good-will, even of those States which were not chargeable with any\n",
      "violation or omission of duty. This would be the more likely to take\n",
      "place, as the delinquencies of the larger members might be expected\n",
      "sometimes to proceed from an ambitious premeditation in their rulers,\n",
      "with a view to getting rid of all external control upon their designs\n",
      "of personal aggrandizement; the better to effect which it is presumable\n",
      "they would tamper beforehand with leading individuals in the adjacent\n",
      "States. If associates could not be found at home, recourse would be\n",
      "had to the aid of foreign powers, who would seldom be disinclined to\n",
      "encouraging the dissensions of a Confederacy, from the firm union\n",
      "of which they had so much to fear. When the sword is once drawn, the\n",
      "passions of men observe no bounds of moderation. The suggestions of\n",
      "wounded pride, the instigations of irritated resentment, would be apt\n",
      "to carry the States against which the arms of the Union were exerted, to\n",
      "any extremes necessary to avenge the affront or to avoid the disgrace\n",
      "of submission. The first war of this kind would probably terminate in a\n",
      "dissolution of the Union.\n",
      "\n",
      "This may be considered as the violent death of the Confederacy. Its more\n",
      "natural death is what we now seem to be on the point of experiencing, if\n",
      "the federal system be not speedily renovated in a more substantial form.\n",
      "It is not probable, considering the genius of this country, that the\n",
      "complying States would often be inclined to support the authority of the\n",
      "Union by engaging in a war against the non-complying States. They would\n",
      "always be more ready to pursue the milder course of putting themselves\n",
      "upon an equal footing with the delinquent members by an imitation of\n",
      "their example. And the guilt of all would thus become the security of\n",
      "all. Our past experience has exhibited the operation of this spirit in\n",
      "its full light. There would, in fact, be an insuperable difficulty in\n",
      "ascertaining when force could with propriety be employed. In the article\n",
      "of pecuniary contribution, which would be the most usual source of\n",
      "delinquency, it would often be impossible to decide whether it had\n",
      "proceeded from disinclination or inability. The pretense of the latter\n",
      "would always be at hand. And the case must be very flagrant in which its\n",
      "fallacy could be detected with sufficient certainty to justify the harsh\n",
      "expedient of compulsion. It is easy to see that this problem alone, as\n",
      "often as it should occur, would open a wide field for the exercise of\n",
      "factious views, of partiality, and of oppression, in the majority that\n",
      "happened to prevail in the national council.\n",

      "It seems to require no pains to prove that the States ought not to\n",
      "prefer a national Constitution which could only be kept in motion by\n",
      "the instrumentality of a large army continually on foot to execute the\n",
      "ordinary requisitions or decrees of the government. And yet this is the\n",
      "plain alternative involved by those who wish to deny it the power of\n",
      "extending its operations to individuals. Such a scheme, if practicable\n",
      "at all, would instantly degenerate into a military despotism; but it\n",
      "will be found in every light impracticable. The resources of the Union\n",
      "would not be equal to the maintenance of an army considerable enough to\n",
      "confine the larger States within the limits of their duty; nor would the\n",
      "means ever be furnished of forming such an army in the first instance.\n",
      "Whoever considers the populousness and strength of several of these\n",
      "States singly at the present juncture, and looks forward to what they\n",

      "movements by laws to operate upon them in their collective capacities,\n",
      "and to be executed by a coercion applicable to them in the same\n",

      "the confederacy has displayed its banners against the other half.\n",
      "\n",
      "The result of these observations to an intelligent mind must be\n",
      "clearly this, that if it be possible at any rate to construct a federal\n",
      "government capable of regulating the common concerns and preserving the\n",
      "general tranquillity, it must be founded, as to the objects committed\n",
      "to its care, upon the reverse of the principle contended for by the\n",
      "opponents of the proposed Constitution. It must carry its agency to\n",
      "the persons of the citizens. It must stand in need of no intermediate\n",
      "legislations; but must itself be empowered to employ the arm of the\n",
      "ordinary magistrate to execute its own resolutions. The majesty of the\n",
      "national authority must be manifested through the medium of the courts\n",
      "of justice. The government of the Union, like that of each State,\n",
      "must be able to address itself immediately to the hopes and fears of\n",
      "individuals; and to attract to its support those passions which have the\n",
      "strongest influence upon the human heart. It must, in short, possess all\n",

      "appears to me to hold out slender allurements to ambition. Commerce,\n",
      "finance, negotiation, and war seem to comprehend all the objects which\n",
      "have charms for minds governed by that passion; and all the powers\n",
      "necessary to those objects ought, in the first instance, to be lodged in\n",
      "the national depository. The administration of private justice between\n",
      "the citizens of the same State, the supervision of agriculture and of\n",
      "other concerns of a similar nature, all those things, in short, which\n",
      "are proper to be provided for by local legislation, can never be\n",
      "desirable cares of a general jurisdiction. It is therefore improbable\n",
      "that there should exist a disposition in the federal councils to\n",
      "usurp the powers with which they are connected; because the attempt to\n",

      "will diffuse itself almost wholly through the channels of the particular\n",

      "Though the ancient feudal systems were not, strictly speaking,\n",
      "confederacies, yet they partook of the nature of that species of\n",
      "association. There was a common head, chieftain, or sovereign, whose\n",
      "authority extended over the whole nation; and a number of subordinate\n",
      "vassals, or feudatories, who had large portions of land allotted to\n",
      "them, and numerous trains of INFERIOR vassals or retainers, who occupied\n",
      "and cultivated that land upon the tenure of fealty or obedience, to\n",
      "the persons of whom they held it. Each principal vassal was a kind of\n",
      "sovereign, within his particular demesnes. The consequences of this\n",
      "situation were a continual opposition to authority of the sovereign, and\n",
      "frequent wars between the great barons or chief feudatories themselves.\n",
      "The power of the head of the nation was commonly too weak, either\n",
      "to preserve the public peace, or to protect the people against the\n",
      "oppressions of their immediate lords. This period of European affairs is\n",
      "emphatically styled by historians, the times of feudal anarchy.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the sovereign happened to be a man of vigorous and warlike temper\n",
      "and of superior abilities, he would acquire a personal weight and\n",
      "influence, which answered, for the time, the purpose of a more regular\n",
      "authority. But in general, the power of the barons triumphed over that\n",
      "of the prince; and in many instances his dominion was entirely thrown\n",
      "off, and the great fiefs were erected into independent principalities or\n",
      "States. In those instances in which the monarch finally prevailed over\n",
      "his vassals, his success was chiefly owing to the tyranny of those\n",
      "vassals over their dependents. The barons, or nobles, equally the\n",
      "enemies of the sovereign and the oppressors of the common people, were\n",
      "dreaded and detested by both; till mutual danger and mutual interest\n",
      "effected a union between them fatal to the power of the aristocracy. Had\n",
      "the nobles, by a conduct of clemency and justice, preserved the fidelity\n",
      "and devotion of their retainers and followers, the contests between them\n",
      "and the prince must almost always have ended in their favor, and in the\n",
      "abridgment or subversion of the royal authority.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is not an assertion founded merely in speculation or conjecture.\n",
      "Among other illustrations of its truth which might be cited, Scotland\n",

      "early day, introduced into that kingdom, uniting the nobles and\n",
      "their dependants by ties equivalent to those of kindred, rendered the\n",
      "aristocracy a constant overmatch for the power of the monarch, till the\n",
      "incorporation with England subdued its fierce and ungovernable spirit,\n",

      "AMONG the confederacies of antiquity, the most considerable was that of\n",
      "the Grecian republics, associated under the Amphictyonic council. From\n",
      "the best accounts transmitted of this celebrated institution, it bore\n",
      "a very instructive analogy to the present Confederation of the American\n",
      "States.\n",
      "\n",
      "The members retained the character of independent and sovereign states,\n",
      "and had equal votes in the federal council. This council had a general\n",
      "authority to propose and resolve whatever it judged necessary for the\n",
      "common welfare of Greece; to declare and carry on war; to decide, in\n",

      "aggressing party; to employ the whole force of the confederacy against\n",
      "the disobedient; to admit new members. The Amphictyons were the\n",
      "guardians of religion, and of the immense riches belonging to the temple\n",
      "of Delphos, where they had the right of jurisdiction in controversies\n",
      "between the inhabitants and those who came to consult the oracle. As a\n",
      "further provision for the efficacy of the federal powers, they took an\n",
      "oath mutually to defend and protect the united cities, to punish\n",
      "the violators of this oath, and to inflict vengeance on sacrilegious\n",
      "despoilers of the temple.\n",
      "\n",
      "In theory, and upon paper, this apparatus of powers seems amply\n",
      "sufficient for all general purposes. In several material instances,\n",
      "they exceed the powers enumerated in the articles of confederation. The\n",
      "Amphictyons had in their hands the superstition of the times, one of the\n",
      "principal engines by which government was then maintained; they had a\n",
      "declared authority to use coercion against refractory cities, and were\n",
      "bound by oath to exert this authority on the necessary occasions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very different, nevertheless, was the experiment from the theory.\n",
      "The powers, like those of the present Congress, were administered by\n",
      "deputies appointed wholly by the cities in their political capacities;\n",
      "and exercised over them in the same capacities. Hence the weakness,\n",
      "the disorders, and finally the destruction of the confederacy. The\n",
      "more powerful members, instead of being kept in awe and subordination,\n",
      "tyrannized successively over all the rest. Athens, as we learn from\n",
      "Demosthenes, was the arbiter of Greece seventy-three years. The\n",
      "Lacedaemonians next governed it twenty-nine years; at a subsequent\n",
      "period, after the battle of Leuctra, the Thebans had their turn of\n",
      "domination.\n",
      "\n",
      "It happened but too often, according to Plutarch, that the deputies of\n",
      "the strongest cities awed and corrupted those of the weaker; and that\n",
      "judgment went in favor of the most powerful party.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even in the midst of defensive and dangerous wars with Persia and\n",
      "Macedon, the members never acted in concert, and were, more or fewer\n",
      "of them, eternally the dupes or the hirelings of the common enemy.\n",
      "The intervals of foreign war were filled up by domestic vicissitudes\n",
      "convulsions, and carnage.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the conclusion of the war with Xerxes, it appears that the\n",
      "Lacedaemonians required that a number of the cities should be turned\n",
      "out of the confederacy for the unfaithful part they had acted. The\n",
      "Athenians, finding that the Lacedaemonians would lose fewer partisans by\n",
      "such a measure than themselves, and would become masters of the public\n",
      "deliberations, vigorously opposed and defeated the attempt. This piece\n",
      "of history proves at once the inefficiency of the union, the ambition\n",
      "and jealousy of its most powerful members, and the dependent and\n",
      "degraded condition of the rest. The smaller members, though entitled by\n",
      "the theory of their system to revolve in equal pride and majesty around\n",
      "the common center, had become, in fact, satellites of the orbs of\n",
      "primary magnitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "Had the Greeks, says the Abbe Milot, been as wise as they were\n",
      "courageous, they would have been admonished by experience of the\n",
      "necessity of a closer union, and would have availed themselves of\n",
      "the peace which followed their success against the Persian arms, to\n",
      "establish such a reformation. Instead of this obvious policy, Athens\n",
      "and Sparta, inflated with the victories and the glory they had acquired,\n",
      "became first rivals and then enemies; and did each other infinitely more\n",
      "mischief than they had suffered from Xerxes. Their mutual jealousies,\n",
      "fears, hatreds, and injuries ended in the celebrated Peloponnesian war;\n",
      "which itself ended in the ruin and slavery of the Athenians who had\n",
      "begun it.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a weak government, when not at war, is ever agitated by internal\n",
      "dissentions, so these never fail to bring on fresh calamities from\n",
      "abroad. The Phocians having ploughed up some consecrated ground\n",
      "belonging to the temple of Apollo, the Amphictyonic council, according\n",
      "to the superstition of the age, imposed a fine on the sacrilegious\n",
      "offenders. The Phocians, being abetted by Athens and Sparta, refused to\n",
      "submit to the decree. The Thebans, with others of the cities, undertook\n",
      "to maintain the authority of the Amphictyons, and to avenge the violated\n",
      "god. The latter, being the weaker party, invited the assistance of\n",
      "Philip of Macedon, who had secretly fostered the contest. Philip gladly\n",
      "seized the opportunity of executing the designs he had long planned\n",
      "against the liberties of Greece. By his intrigues and bribes he won\n",
      "over to his interests the popular leaders of several cities; by their\n",
      "influence and votes, gained admission into the Amphictyonic council; and\n",
      "by his arts and his arms, made himself master of the confederacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such were the consequences of the fallacious principle on which this\n",
      "interesting establishment was founded. Had Greece, says a judicious\n",
      "observer on her fate, been united by a stricter confederation, and\n",
      "persevered in her union, she would never have worn the chains of\n",
      "Macedon; and might have proved a barrier to the vast projects of Rome.\n",

      "The Achaean league, as it is called, was another society of Grecian\n",
      "republics, which supplies us with valuable instruction.\n",

      "The Union here was far more intimate, and its organization much wiser,\n",
      "than in the preceding instance. It will accordingly appear, that though\n",
      "not exempt from a similar catastrophe, it by no means equally deserved\n",
      "it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cities composing this league retained their municipal jurisdiction,\n",
      "appointed their own officers, and enjoyed a perfect equality. The\n",
      "senate, in which they were represented, had the sole and exclusive right\n",
      "of peace and war; of sending and receiving ambassadors; of entering into\n",
      "treaties and alliances; of appointing a chief magistrate or praetor, as\n",
      "he was called, who commanded their armies, and who, with the advice and\n",
      "consent of ten of the senators, not only administered the government in\n",
      "the recess of the senate, but had a great share in its deliberations,\n",
      "when assembled. According to the primitive constitution, there were two\n",
      "praetors associated in the administration; but on trial a single one was\n",
      "preferred.\n",
      "\n",
      "It appears that the cities had all the same laws and customs, the\n",
      "same weights and measures, and the same money. But how far this\n",
      "effect proceeded from the authority of the federal council is left in\n",
      "uncertainty. It is said only that the cities were in a manner compelled\n",
      "to receive the same laws and usages. When Lacedaemon was brought into\n",

      "institutions and laws of Lycurgus, and an adoption of those of the\n",
      "Achaeans. The Amphictyonic confederacy, of which she had been a member,\n",
      "left her in the full exercise of her government and her legislation.\n",

      "experiments with which we are acquainted.\n",
      "\n",
      "One important fact seems to be witnessed by all the historians who take\n",
      "notice of Achaean affairs. It is, that as well after the renovation of\n",
      "the league by Aratus, as before its dissolution by the arts of\n",
      "Macedon, there was infinitely more of moderation and justice in the\n",
      "administration of its government, and less of violence and sedition in\n",
      "the people, than were to be found in any of the cities exercising SINGLY\n",
      "all the prerogatives of sovereignty. The Abbe Mably, in his observations\n",
      "on Greece, says that the popular government, which was so tempestuous\n",
      "elsewhere, caused no disorders in the members of the Achaean republic,\n",
      "BECAUSE IT WAS THERE TEMPERED BY THE GENERAL AUTHORITY AND LAWS OF THE\n",
      "CONFEDERACY.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are not to conclude too hastily, however, that faction did not, in\n",
      "a certain degree, agitate the particular cities; much less that a due\n",
      "subordination and harmony reigned in the general system. The contrary is\n",
      "sufficiently displayed in the vicissitudes and fate of the republic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whilst the Amphictyonic confederacy remained, that of the Achaeans,\n",
      "which comprehended the less important cities only, made little figure on\n",
      "the theatre of Greece. When the former became a victim to Macedon,\n",
      "the latter was spared by the policy of Philip and Alexander. Under the\n",
      "successors of these princes, however, a different policy prevailed.\n",
      "The arts of division were practiced among the Achaeans. Each city was\n",
      "seduced into a separate interest; the union was dissolved. Some of the\n",
      "cities fell under the tyranny of Macedonian garrisons; others under that\n",
      "of usurpers springing out of their own confusions. Shame and oppression\n",
      "erelong awaken their love of liberty. A few cities reunited. Their\n",
      "example was followed by others, as opportunities were found of\n",
      "cutting off their tyrants. The league soon embraced almost the whole\n",
      "Peloponnesus. Macedon saw its progress; but was hindered by internal\n",
      "dissensions from stopping it. All Greece caught the enthusiasm and\n",
      "seemed ready to unite in one confederacy, when the jealousy and envy in\n",
      "Sparta and Athens, of the rising glory of the Achaeans, threw a fatal\n",
      "damp on the enterprise. The dread of the Macedonian power induced the\n",
      "league to court the alliance of the Kings of Egypt and Syria, who, as\n",
      "successors of Alexander, were rivals of the king of Macedon. This policy\n",
      "was defeated by Cleomenes, king of Sparta, who was led by his ambition\n",
      "to make an unprovoked attack on his neighbors, the Achaeans, and who,\n",
      "as an enemy to Macedon, had interest enough with the Egyptian and Syrian\n",
      "princes to effect a breach of their engagements with the league.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Achaeans were now reduced to the dilemma of submitting to Cleomenes,\n",
      "or of supplicating the aid of Macedon, its former oppressor. The latter\n",
      "expedient was adopted. The contests of the Greeks always afforded a\n",
      "pleasing opportunity to that powerful neighbor of intermeddling in their\n",
      "affairs. A Macedonian army quickly appeared. Cleomenes was vanquished.\n",
      "The Achaeans soon experienced, as often happens, that a victorious and\n",
      "powerful ally is but another name for a master. All that their most\n",
      "abject compliances could obtain from him was a toleration of the\n",
      "exercise of their laws. Philip, who was now on the throne of Macedon,\n",
      "soon provoked by his tyrannies, fresh combinations among the Greeks. The\n",
      "Achaeans, though weakened by internal dissensions and by the revolt\n",
      "of Messene, one of its members, being joined by the AEtolians and\n",
      "Athenians, erected the standard of opposition. Finding themselves,\n",
      "though thus supported, unequal to the undertaking, they once more had\n",
      "recourse to the dangerous expedient of introducing the succor of foreign\n",
      "arms. The Romans, to whom the invitation was made, eagerly embraced\n",
      "it. Philip was conquered; Macedon subdued. A new crisis ensued to\n",
      "the league. Dissensions broke out among it members. These the Romans\n",
      "fostered. Callicrates and other popular leaders became mercenary\n",
      "instruments for inveigling their countrymen. The more effectually to\n",
      "nourish discord and disorder the Romans had, to the astonishment of\n",
      "those who confided in their sincerity, already proclaimed universal\n",
      "liberty(1) throughout Greece. With the same insidious views, they now\n",
      "seduced the members from the league, by representing to their pride the\n",
      "violation it committed on their sovereignty. By these arts this union,\n",
      "the last hope of Greece, the last hope of ancient liberty, was torn into\n",
      "pieces; and such imbecility and distraction introduced, that the arms of\n",
      "Rome found little difficulty in completing the ruin which their arts\n",
      "had commenced. The Achaeans were cut to pieces, and Achaia loaded with\n",
      "chains, under which it is groaning at this hour.\n",

      "THE examples of ancient confederacies, cited in my last paper, have not\n",
      "exhausted the source of experimental instruction on this subject. There\n",
      "are existing institutions, founded on a similar principle, which\n",
      "merit particular consideration. The first which presents itself is the\n",
      "Germanic body.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the early ages of Christianity, Germany was occupied by seven\n",
      "distinct nations, who had no common chief. The Franks, one of the\n",
      "number, having conquered the Gauls, established the kingdom which has\n",
      "taken its name from them. In the ninth century Charlemagne, its warlike\n",
      "monarch, carried his victorious arms in every direction; and Germany\n",
      "became a part of his vast dominions. On the dismemberment, which\n",
      "took place under his sons, this part was erected into a separate and\n",
      "independent empire. Charlemagne and his immediate descendants possessed\n",
      "the reality, as well as the ensigns and dignity of imperial power.\n",
      "But the principal vassals, whose fiefs had become hereditary, and\n",
      "who composed the national diets which Charlemagne had not abolished,\n",
      "gradually threw off the yoke and advanced to sovereign jurisdiction\n",
      "and independence. The force of imperial sovereignty was insufficient\n",
      "to restrain such powerful dependants; or to preserve the unity and\n",
      "tranquillity of the empire. The most furious private wars, accompanied\n",
      "with every species of calamity, were carried on between the different\n",
      "princes and states. The imperial authority, unable to maintain the\n",
      "public order, declined by degrees till it was almost extinct in the\n",
      "anarchy, which agitated the long interval between the death of the last\n",
      "emperor of the Suabian, and the accession of the first emperor of\n",
      "the Austrian lines. In the eleventh century the emperors enjoyed full\n",
      "sovereignty: In the fifteenth they had little more than the symbols and\n",
      "decorations of power.\n",
      "\n",
      "Out of this feudal system, which has itself many of the important\n",
      "features of a confederacy, has grown the federal system which\n",
      "constitutes the Germanic empire. Its powers are vested in a diet\n",
      "representing the component members of the confederacy; in the emperor,\n",
      "who is the executive magistrate, with a negative on the decrees of the\n",
      "diet; and in the imperial chamber and the aulic council, two judiciary\n",
      "tribunals having supreme jurisdiction in controversies which concern the\n",
      "empire, or which happen among its members.\n",
      "\n",
      "The diet possesses the general power of legislating for the empire; of\n",
      "making war and peace; contracting alliances; assessing quotas of troops\n",
      "and money; constructing fortresses; regulating coin; admitting new\n",
      "members; and subjecting disobedient members to the ban of the empire,\n",
      "by which the party is degraded from his sovereign rights and his\n",
      "possessions forfeited. The members of the confederacy are expressly\n",
      "restricted from entering into compacts prejudicial to the empire; from\n",
      "imposing tolls and duties on their mutual intercourse, without the\n",
      "consent of the emperor and diet; from altering the value of money; from\n",
      "doing injustice to one another; or from affording assistance or retreat\n",
      "to disturbers of the public peace. And the ban is denounced against such\n",
      "as shall violate any of these restrictions. The members of the diet, as\n",
      "such, are subject in all cases to be judged by the emperor and diet, and\n",
      "in their private capacities by the aulic council and imperial chamber.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prerogatives of the emperor are numerous. The most important of them\n",
      "are: his exclusive right to make propositions to the diet; to negative\n",
      "its resolutions; to name ambassadors; to confer dignities and titles; to\n",
      "fill vacant electorates; to found universities; to grant privileges not\n",
      "injurious to the states of the empire; to receive and apply the public\n",
      "revenues; and generally to watch over the public safety. In certain\n",
      "cases, the electors form a council to him. In quality of emperor, he\n",
      "possesses no territory within the empire, nor receives any revenue\n",
      "for his support. But his revenue and dominions, in other qualities,\n",
      "constitute him one of the most powerful princes in Europe.\n",

      "principle on which it rests, that the empire is a community of\n",
      "sovereigns, that the diet is a representation of sovereigns and that the\n",
      "laws are addressed to sovereigns, renders the empire a nerveless body,\n",

      "of the conflicts, the emperor himself was put to flight, and very near\n",
      "being made prisoner by the elector of Saxony. The late king of Prussia\n",
      "was more than once pitted against his imperial sovereign; and commonly\n",
      "proved an overmatch for him. Controversies and wars among the members\n",
      "themselves have been so common, that the German annals are crowded\n",
      "with the bloody pages which describe them. Previous to the peace of\n",
      "Westphalia, Germany was desolated by a war of thirty years, in which the\n",
      "emperor, with one half of the empire, was on one side, and Sweden, with\n",
      "the other half, on the opposite side. Peace was at length negotiated,\n",
      "and dictated by foreign powers; and the articles of it, to which\n",

      "\n",
      "If the nation happens, on any emergency, to be more united by the\n",
      "necessity of self-defense, its situation is still deplorable. Military\n",
      "preparations must be preceded by so many tedious discussions, arising\n",
      "from the jealousies, pride, separate views, and clashing pretensions of\n",
      "sovereign bodies, that before the diet can settle the arrangements, the\n",

      "it, are retiring into winter quarters.\n",

      "The small body of national troops, which has been judged necessary in\n",
      "time of peace, is defectively kept up, badly paid, infected with\n",

      "contributions to the treasury.\n",
      "\n",
      "The impossibility of maintaining order and dispensing justice among\n",
      "these sovereign subjects, produced the experiment of dividing the\n",
      "empire into nine or ten circles or districts; of giving them an interior\n",
      "organization, and of charging them with the military execution of the\n",
      "laws against delinquent and contumacious members. This experiment\n",
      "has only served to demonstrate more fully the radical vice of the\n",
      "constitution. Each circle is the miniature picture of the deformities of\n",
      "this political monster. They either fail to execute their commissions,\n",
      "or they do it with all the devastation and carnage of civil war.\n",
      "Sometimes whole circles are defaulters; and then they increase the\n",
      "mischief which they were instituted to remedy.\n",
      "\n",
      "We may form some judgment of this scheme of military coercion from a\n",
      "sample given by Thuanus. In Donawerth, a free and imperial city of the\n",
      "circle of Suabia, the Abbe de St. Croix enjoyed certain immunities\n",
      "which had been reserved to him. In the exercise of these, on some public\n",
      "occasions, outrages were committed on him by the people of the city. The\n",
      "consequence was that the city was put under the ban of the empire, and\n",
      "the Duke of Bavaria, though director of another circle, obtained an\n",
      "appointment to enforce it. He soon appeared before the city with a\n",
      "corps of ten thousand troops, and finding it a fit occasion, as he had\n",
      "secretly intended from the beginning, to revive an antiquated claim, on\n",
      "the pretext that his ancestors had suffered the place to be dismembered\n",
      "from his territory,(1) he took possession of it in his own name,\n",
      "disarmed, and punished the inhabitants, and reannexed the city to his\n",
      "domains.\n",
      "\n",
      "It may be asked, perhaps, what has so long kept this disjointed machine\n",
      "from falling entirely to pieces? The answer is obvious: The weakness of\n",
      "most of the members, who are unwilling to expose themselves to the\n",
      "mercy of foreign powers; the weakness of most of the principal members,\n",
      "compared with the formidable powers all around them; the vast weight\n",
      "and influence which the emperor derives from his separate and hereditary\n",
      "dominions; and the interest he feels in preserving a system with which\n",
      "his family pride is connected, and which constitutes him the first\n",
      "prince in Europe;--these causes support a feeble and precarious Union;\n",
      "whilst the repellant quality, incident to the nature of sovereignty,\n",
      "and which time continually strengthens, prevents any reform whatever,\n",
      "founded on a proper consolidation. Nor is it to be imagined, if this\n",
      "obstacle could be surmounted, that the neighboring powers would suffer\n",
      "a revolution to take place which would give to the empire the force\n",
      "and preeminence to which it is entitled. Foreign nations have long\n",
      "considered themselves as interested in the changes made by events in\n",
      "this constitution; and have, on various occasions, betrayed their policy\n",
      "of perpetuating its anarchy and weakness.\n",
      "\n",
      "If more direct examples were wanting, Poland, as a government over local\n",

      "insurrections and rebellions, an aid expressly stipulated and often\n",
      "required and afforded; and by the necessity of some regular and\n",
      "permanent provision for accommodating disputes among the cantons. The\n",
      "provision is, that the parties at variance shall each choose four judges\n",
      "out of the neutral cantons, who, in case of disagreement, choose\n",
      "an umpire. This tribunal, under an oath of impartiality, pronounces\n",
      "definitive sentence, which all the cantons are bound to enforce. The\n",
      "competency of this regulation may be estimated by a clause in their\n",
      "treaty of 1683, with Victor Amadeus of Savoy; in which he obliges\n",

      "consumption, may be compared to a fluid, which will, in time, find its\n",
      "level with the means of paying them. The amount to be contributed by\n",
      "each citizen will in a degree be at his own option, and can be regulated\n",

      "quotas, upon any scale that can possibly be devised.\n",

      "proposed, that is, an extension of the revenue. When applied to this\n",
      "object, the saying is as just as it is witty, that, \"in political\n",
      "arithmetic, two and two do not always make four.\" If duties are too\n",
      "high, they lessen the consumption; the collection is eluded; and the\n",
      "product to the treasury is not so great as when they are confined within\n",
      "proper and moderate bounds. This forms a complete barrier against any\n",

      "the impropriety of an equal vote between States of the most unequal\n",
      "dimensions and populousness; nor is the inference accurate in point\n",
      "of fact; for we can enumerate nine States which contain less than a\n",
      "majority of the people;(4) and it is constitutionally possible that\n",
      "these nine may give the vote. Besides, there are matters of considerable\n",
      "moment determinable by a bare majority; and there are others, concerning\n",
      "which doubts have been entertained, which, if interpreted in favor of\n",
      "the sufficiency of a vote of seven States, would extend its operation\n",
      "to interests of the first magnitude. In addition to this, it is to be\n",

      "has an effect the reverse of what is expected from it in theory. The\n",
      "necessity of unanimity in public bodies, or of something approaching\n",
      "towards it, has been founded upon a supposition that it would contribute\n",
      "to security. But its real operation is to embarrass the administration,\n",

      "contemptible compromises of the public good. And yet, in such a system,\n",
      "it is even happy when such compromises can take place: for upon some\n",
      "occasions things will not admit of accommodation; and then the measures\n",
      "of government must be injuriously suspended, or fatally defeated. It\n",
      "is often, by the impracticability of obtaining the concurrence of the\n",
      "necessary number of votes, kept in a state of inaction. Its situation\n",
      "must always savor of weakness, sometimes border upon anarchy.\n",

      "From the New York Packet. Wednesday, January 9, 1788\n",
      "\n",
      "HAMILTON\n",
      "\n",
      "To the People of the State of New York:\n",
      "\n",
      "THE power of regulating the militia, and of commanding its services in\n",
      "times of insurrection and invasion are natural incidents to the duties\n",
      "of superintending the common defense, and of watching over the internal\n",
      "peace of the Confederacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "It requires no skill in the science of war to discern that uniformity\n",
      "in the organization and discipline of the militia would be attended with\n",
      "the most beneficial effects, whenever they were called into service for\n",
      "the public defense. It would enable them to discharge the duties of the\n",
      "camp and of the field with mutual intelligence and concert an advantage\n",
      "of peculiar moment in the operations of an army; and it would fit them\n",
      "much sooner to acquire the degree of proficiency in military functions\n",
      "which would be essential to their usefulness. This desirable uniformity\n",
      "can only be accomplished by confiding the regulation of the militia to\n",
      "the direction of the national authority. It is, therefore, with the most\n",
      "evident propriety, that the plan of the convention proposes to empower\n",
      "the Union \"to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the\n",
      "militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the\n",
      "service of the United States, RESERVING TO THE STATES RESPECTIVELY THE\n",
      "APPOINTMENT OF THE OFFICERS, AND THE AUTHORITY OF TRAINING THE MILITIA\n",
      "ACCORDING TO THE DISCIPLINE PRESCRIBED BY CONGRESS.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Of the different grounds which have been taken in opposition to the\n",
      "plan of the convention, there is none that was so little to have been\n",
      "expected, or is so untenable in itself, as the one from which this\n",
      "particular provision has been attacked. If a well-regulated militia be\n",
      "the most natural defense of a free country, it ought certainly to\n",
      "be under the regulation and at the disposal of that body which is\n",
      "constituted the guardian of the national security. If standing armies\n",
      "are dangerous to liberty, an efficacious power over the militia, in the\n",
      "body to whose care the protection of the State is committed, ought, as\n",
      "far as possible, to take away the inducement and the pretext to such\n",
      "unfriendly institutions. If the federal government can command the aid\n",
      "of the militia in those emergencies which call for the military arm in\n",
      "support of the civil magistrate, it can the better dispense with the\n",
      "employment of a different kind of force. If it cannot avail itself of\n",
      "the former, it will be obliged to recur to the latter. To render an army\n",
      "unnecessary, will be a more certain method of preventing its existence\n",
      "than a thousand prohibitions upon paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to cast an odium upon the power of calling forth the militia\n",
      "to execute the laws of the Union, it has been remarked that there is\n",
      "nowhere any provision in the proposed Constitution for calling out the\n",
      "POSSE COMITATUS, to assist the magistrate in the execution of his duty,\n",
      "whence it has been inferred, that military force was intended to be his\n",
      "only auxiliary. There is a striking incoherence in the objections\n",
      "which have appeared, and sometimes even from the same quarter, not much\n",
      "calculated to inspire a very favorable opinion of the sincerity or fair\n",
      "dealing of their authors. The same persons who tell us in one breath,\n",
      "that the powers of the federal government will be despotic and\n",
      "unlimited, inform us in the next, that it has not authority sufficient\n",
      "even to call out the POSSE COMITATUS. The latter, fortunately, is as\n",
      "much short of the truth as the former exceeds it. It would be as absurd\n",
      "to doubt, that a right to pass all laws NECESSARY AND PROPER to execute\n",
      "its declared powers, would include that of requiring the assistance of\n",
      "the citizens to the officers who may be intrusted with the execution\n",
      "of those laws, as it would be to believe, that a right to enact laws\n",
      "necessary and proper for the imposition and collection of taxes would\n",
      "involve that of varying the rules of descent and of the alienation of\n",
      "landed property, or of abolishing the trial by jury in cases relating to\n",
      "it. It being therefore evident that the supposition of a want of power\n",
      "to require the aid of the POSSE COMITATUS is entirely destitute of\n",
      "color, it will follow, that the conclusion which has been drawn from it,\n",
      "in its application to the authority of the federal government over the\n",
      "militia, is as uncandid as it is illogical. What reason could there\n",
      "be to infer, that force was intended to be the sole instrument of\n",
      "authority, merely because there is a power to make use of it when\n",
      "necessary? What shall we think of the motives which could induce men of\n",
      "sense to reason in this manner? How shall we prevent a conflict between\n",
      "charity and conviction?\n",
      "\n",
      "By a curious refinement upon the spirit of republican jealousy, we are\n",
      "even taught to apprehend danger from the militia itself, in the hands of\n",
      "the federal government. It is observed that select corps may be formed,\n",
      "composed of the young and ardent, who may be rendered subservient to the\n",
      "views of arbitrary power. What plan for the regulation of the militia\n",
      "may be pursued by the national government, is impossible to be foreseen.\n",
      "But so far from viewing the matter in the same light with those who\n",
      "object to select corps as dangerous, were the Constitution ratified, and\n",
      "were I to deliver my sentiments to a member of the federal legislature\n",
      "from this State on the subject of a militia establishment, I should hold\n",
      "to him, in substance, the following discourse:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The project of disciplining all the militia of the United States is\n",
      "as futile as it would be injurious, if it were capable of being carried\n",
      "into execution. A tolerable expertness in military movements is a\n",
      "business that requires time and practice. It is not a day, or even a\n",
      "week, that will suffice for the attainment of it. To oblige the great\n",
      "body of the yeomanry, and of the other classes of the citizens, to\n",
      "be under arms for the purpose of going through military exercises and\n",
      "evolutions, as often as might be necessary to acquire the degree of\n",
      "perfection which would entitle them to the character of a well-regulated\n",
      "militia, would be a real grievance to the people, and a serious public\n",
      "inconvenience and loss. It would form an annual deduction from the\n",
      "productive labor of the country, to an amount which, calculating upon\n",
      "the present numbers of the people, would not fall far short of the whole\n",
      "expense of the civil establishments of all the States. To attempt\n",
      "a thing which would abridge the mass of labor and industry to so\n",
      "considerable an extent, would be unwise: and the experiment, if made,\n",
      "could not succeed, because it would not long be endured. Little more\n",
      "can reasonably be aimed at, with respect to the people at large, than to\n",
      "have them properly armed and equipped; and in order to see that this be\n",
      "not neglected, it will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in\n",
      "the course of a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But though the scheme of disciplining the whole nation must be\n",
      "abandoned as mischievous or impracticable; yet it is a matter of the\n",
      "utmost importance that a well-digested plan should, as soon as possible,\n",
      "be adopted for the proper establishment of the militia. The attention of\n",
      "the government ought particularly to be directed to the formation of a\n",
      "select corps of moderate extent, upon such principles as will really fit\n",
      "them for service in case of need. By thus circumscribing the plan, it\n",
      "will be possible to have an excellent body of well-trained militia,\n",
      "ready to take the field whenever the defense of the State shall require\n",
      "it. This will not only lessen the call for military establishments, but\n",
      "if circumstances should at any time oblige the government to form an\n",
      "army of any magnitude that army can never be formidable to the liberties\n",
      "of the people while there is a large body of citizens, little, if at\n",
      "all, inferior to them in discipline and the use of arms, who stand ready\n",
      "to defend their own rights and those of their fellow-citizens. This\n",
      "appears to me the only substitute that can be devised for a standing\n",
      "army, and the best possible security against it, if it should exist.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus differently from the adversaries of the proposed Constitution\n",
      "should I reason on the same subject, deducing arguments of safety\n",
      "from the very sources which they represent as fraught with danger and\n",
      "perdition. But how the national legislature may reason on the point, is\n",
      "a thing which neither they nor I can foresee.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is something so far-fetched and so extravagant in the idea of\n",
      "danger to liberty from the militia, that one is at a loss whether to\n",
      "treat it with gravity or with raillery; whether to consider it as a mere\n",
      "trial of skill, like the paradoxes of rhetoricians; as a disingenuous\n",
      "artifice to instil prejudices at any price; or as the serious offspring\n",
      "of political fanaticism. Where in the name of common-sense, are our\n",
      "fears to end if we may not trust our sons, our brothers, our neighbors,\n",
      "our fellow-citizens? What shadow of danger can there be from men who\n",
      "are daily mingling with the rest of their countrymen and who participate\n",
      "with them in the same feelings, sentiments, habits and interests? What\n",
      "reasonable cause of apprehension can be inferred from a power in the\n",
      "Union to prescribe regulations for the militia, and to command its\n",
      "services when necessary, while the particular States are to have the\n",
      "SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE APPOINTMENT OF THE OFFICERS? If it were possible\n",
      "seriously to indulge a jealousy of the militia upon any conceivable\n",
      "establishment under the federal government, the circumstance of the\n",
      "officers being in the appointment of the States ought at once to\n",
      "extinguish it. There can be no doubt that this circumstance will always\n",
      "secure to them a preponderating influence over the militia.\n",

      "in which proposition was intended to be included the expense of raising\n",
      "troops, of building and equipping fleets, and all other expenses in any\n",

      "Money is, with propriety, considered as the vital principle of the body\n",

      "would only exist in three cases: where the Constitution in express terms\n",
      "granted an exclusive authority to the Union; where it granted in one\n",
      "instance an authority to the Union, and in another prohibited the States\n",
      "from exercising the like authority; and where it granted an authority\n",
      "to the Union, to which a similar authority in the States would be\n",
      "absolutely and totally CONTRADICTORY and REPUGNANT. I use these terms to\n",
      "distinguish this last case from another which might appear to resemble\n",
      "it, but which would, in fact, be essentially different; I mean where the\n",
      "exercise of a concurrent jurisdiction might be productive of occasional\n",
      "interferences in the POLICY of any branch of administration, but\n",
      "would not imply any direct contradiction or repugnancy in point of\n",
      "constitutional authority. These three cases of exclusive jurisdiction\n",
      "in the federal government may be exemplified by the following instances:\n",
      "The last clause but one in the eighth section of the first article\n",
      "provides expressly that Congress shall exercise \"EXCLUSIVE LEGISLATION\"\n",
      "over the district to be appropriated as the seat of government. This\n",
      "answers to the first case. The first clause of the same section empowers\n",
      "Congress \"to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises\"; and\n",
      "the second clause of the tenth section of the same article declares\n",
      "that, \"NO STATE SHALL, without the consent of Congress, lay any imposts\n",
      "or duties on imports or exports, except for the purpose of executing its\n",
      "inspection laws.\" Hence would result an exclusive power in the Union\n",
      "to lay duties on imports and exports, with the particular exception\n",
      "mentioned; but this power is abridged by another clause, which declares\n",
      "that no tax or duty shall be laid on articles exported from any State;\n",
      "in consequence of which qualification, it now only extends to the DUTIES\n",
      "ON IMPORTS. This answers to the second case. The third will be found in\n",
      "that clause which declares that Congress shall have power \"to establish\n",
      "an UNIFORM RULE of naturalization throughout the United States.\" This\n",
      "must necessarily be exclusive; because if each State had power to\n",
      "prescribe a DISTINCT RULE, there could not be a UNIFORM RULE.\n",
      "\n",
      "A case which may perhaps be thought to resemble the latter, but which\n",
      "is in fact widely different, affects the question immediately under\n",
      "consideration. I mean the power of imposing taxes on all articles other\n",
      "than exports and imports. This, I contend, is manifestly a concurrent\n",
      "and coequal authority in the United States and in the individual States.\n",
      "There is plainly no expression in the granting clause which makes that\n",
      "power EXCLUSIVE in the Union. There is no independent clause or sentence\n",
      "which prohibits the States from exercising it. So far is this from being\n",
      "the case, that a plain and conclusive argument to the contrary is to be\n",
      "deduced from the restraint laid upon the States in relation to duties on\n",
      "imports and exports. This restriction implies an admission that, if it\n",
      "were not inserted, the States would possess the power it excludes;\n",
      "and it implies a further admission, that as to all other taxes, the\n",
      "authority of the States remains undiminished. In any other view it would\n",
      "be both unnecessary and dangerous; it would be unnecessary, because if\n",
      "the grant to the Union of the power of laying such duties implied the\n",
      "exclusion of the States, or even their subordination in this particular,\n",
      "there could be no need of such a restriction; it would be dangerous,\n",
      "because the introduction of it leads directly to the conclusion which\n",
      "has been mentioned, and which, if the reasoning of the objectors be\n",
      "just, could not have been intended; I mean that the States, in all cases\n",
      "to which the restriction did not apply, would have a concurrent power\n",
      "of taxation with the Union. The restriction in question amounts to what\n",
      "lawyers call a NEGATIVE PREGNANT that is, a NEGATION of one thing, and\n",
      "an AFFIRMANCE of another; a negation of the authority of the States\n",
      "to impose taxes on imports and exports, and an affirmance of their\n",
      "authority to impose them on all other articles. It would be mere\n",
      "sophistry to argue that it was meant to exclude them ABSOLUTELY from the\n",

      "bound to observe. This results from every political association. If\n",

      "community to defray from a tenth to a twentieth part of its expenses;\n",
      "and to the Union, one third of the resources of the community, to defray\n",
      "from nine tenths to nineteen twentieths of its expenses. If we desert\n",
      "this boundary and content ourselves with leaving to the States an\n",
      "exclusive power of taxing houses and lands, there would still be a great\n",
      "disproportion between the MEANS and the END; the possession of one third\n",
      "of the resources of the community to supply, at most, one tenth of its\n",
      "wants. If any fund could have been selected and appropriated, equal to\n",
      "and not greater than the object, it would have been inadequate to the\n",

      "BEFORE we proceed to examine any other objections to an indefinite power\n",
      "of taxation in the Union, I shall make one general remark; which is,\n",
      "that if the jurisdiction of the national government, in the article of\n",
      "revenue, should be restricted to particular objects, it would naturally\n",
      "occasion an undue proportion of the public burdens to fall upon those\n",
      "objects. Two evils would spring from this source: the oppression of\n",
      "particular branches of industry; and an unequal distribution of the\n",
      "taxes, as well among the several States as among the citizens of the\n",
      "same State.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suppose, as has been contended for, the federal power of taxation were\n",
      "to be confined to duties on imports, it is evident that the government,\n",
      "for want of being able to command other resources, would frequently be\n",
      "tempted to extend these duties to an injurious excess. There are persons\n",
      "who imagine that they can never be carried to too great a length; since\n",
      "the higher they are, the more it is alleged they will tend to discourage\n",
      "an extravagant consumption, to produce a favorable balance of trade,\n",
      "and to promote domestic manufactures. But all extremes are pernicious\n",
      "in various ways. Exorbitant duties on imported articles would beget a\n",
      "general spirit of smuggling; which is always prejudicial to the fair\n",
      "trader, and eventually to the revenue itself: they tend to render\n",
      "other classes of the community tributary, in an improper degree, to the\n",
      "manufacturing classes, to whom they give a premature monopoly of the\n",
      "markets; they sometimes force industry out of its more natural channels\n",
      "into others in which it flows with less advantage; and in the last\n",
      "place, they oppress the merchant, who is often obliged to pay them\n",
      "himself without any retribution from the consumer. When the demand is\n",
      "equal to the quantity of goods at market, the consumer generally\n",
      "pays the duty; but when the markets happen to be overstocked, a great\n",
      "proportion falls upon the merchant, and sometimes not only exhausts\n",
      "his profits, but breaks in upon his capital. I am apt to think that\n",
      "a division of the duty, between the seller and the buyer, more often\n",
      "happens than is commonly imagined. It is not always possible to raise\n",
      "the price of a commodity in exact proportion to every additional\n",
      "imposition laid upon it. The merchant, especially in a country of small\n",
      "commercial capital, is often under a necessity of keeping prices down in\n",
      "order to a more expeditious sale.\n",
      "\n",
      "The maxim that the consumer is the payer, is so much oftener true than\n",
      "the reverse of the proposition, that it is far more equitable that the\n",
      "duties on imports should go into a common stock, than that they should\n",
      "redound to the exclusive benefit of the importing States. But it is not\n",
      "so generally true as to render it equitable, that those duties should\n",
      "form the only national fund. When they are paid by the merchant they\n",
      "operate as an additional tax upon the importing State, whose citizens\n",
      "pay their proportion of them in the character of consumers. In this view\n",
      "they are productive of inequality among the States; which inequality\n",
      "would be increased with the increased extent of the duties. The\n",
      "confinement of the national revenues to this species of imposts would\n",
      "be attended with inequality, from a different cause, between the\n",
      "manufacturing and the non-manufacturing States. The States which can\n",
      "go farthest towards the supply of their own wants, by their own\n",
      "manufactures, will not, according to their numbers or wealth, consume so\n",
      "great a proportion of imported articles as those States which are not\n",
      "in the same favorable situation. They would not, therefore, in this mode\n",
      "alone contribute to the public treasury in a ratio to their abilities.\n",
      "To make them do this it is necessary that recourse be had to excises,\n",
      "the proper objects of which are particular kinds of manufactures. New\n",
      "York is more deeply interested in these considerations than such of\n",
      "her citizens as contend for limiting the power of the Union to external\n",
      "taxation may be aware of. New York is an importing State, and is not\n",
      "likely speedily to be, to any great extent, a manufacturing State.\n",
      "She would, of course, suffer in a double light from restraining the\n",
      "jurisdiction of the Union to commercial imposts.\n",
      "\n",
      "So far as these observations tend to inculcate a danger of the import\n",
      "duties being extended to an injurious extreme it may be observed,\n",
      "conformably to a remark made in another part of these papers, that the\n",
      "interest of the revenue itself would be a sufficient guard against such\n",
      "an extreme. I readily admit that this would be the case, as long as\n",
      "other resources were open; but if the avenues to them were closed, HOPE,\n",
      "stimulated by necessity, would beget experiments, fortified by rigorous\n",

      "experience to correct. Necessity, especially in politics, often\n",
      "occasions false hopes, false reasonings, and a system of measures\n",
      "correspondingly erroneous. But even if this supposed excess should not\n",
      "be a consequence of the limitation of the federal power of taxation, the\n",
      "inequalities spoken of would still ensue, though not in the same degree,\n",
      "from the other causes that have been noticed. Let us now return to the\n",
      "examination of objections.\n",
      "\n",
      "One which, if we may judge from the frequency of its repetition, seems\n",
      "most to be relied on, is, that the House of Representatives is not\n",
      "sufficiently numerous for the reception of all the different classes of\n",
      "citizens, in order to combine the interests and feelings of every\n",
      "part of the community, and to produce a due sympathy between the\n",
      "representative body and its constituents. This argument presents itself\n",
      "under a very specious and seducing form; and is well calculated to lay\n",
      "hold of the prejudices of those to whom it is addressed. But when we\n",
      "come to dissect it with attention, it will appear to be made up of\n",
      "nothing but fair-sounding words. The object it seems to aim at is,\n",
      "in the first place, impracticable, and in the sense in which it\n",
      "is contended for, is unnecessary. I reserve for another place the\n",
      "discussion of the question which relates to the sufficiency of the\n",
      "representative body in respect to numbers, and shall content myself\n",
      "with examining here the particular use which has been made of a contrary\n",
      "supposition, in reference to the immediate subject of our inquiries.\n",
      "\n",
      "The idea of an actual representation of all classes of the people, by\n",
      "persons of each class, is altogether visionary. Unless it were expressly\n",
      "provided in the Constitution, that each different occupation should\n",
      "send one or more members, the thing would never take place in\n",
      "practice. Mechanics and manufacturers will always be inclined, with few\n",
      "exceptions, to give their votes to merchants, in preference to persons\n",
      "of their own professions or trades. Those discerning citizens are well\n",
      "aware that the mechanic and manufacturing arts furnish the materials\n",
      "of mercantile enterprise and industry. Many of them, indeed, are\n",
      "immediately connected with the operations of commerce. They know that\n",
      "the merchant is their natural patron and friend; and they are aware,\n",
      "that however great the confidence they may justly feel in their own good\n",
      "sense, their interests can be more effectually promoted by the merchant\n",
      "than by themselves. They are sensible that their habits in life have not\n",
      "been such as to give them those acquired endowments, without which, in\n",
      "a deliberative assembly, the greatest natural abilities are for the\n",
      "most part useless; and that the influence and weight, and superior\n",
      "acquirements of the merchants render them more equal to a contest with\n",
      "any spirit which might happen to infuse itself into the public\n",
      "councils, unfriendly to the manufacturing and trading interests. These\n",
      "considerations, and many others that might be mentioned prove, and\n",
      "experience confirms it, that artisans and manufacturers will commonly\n",
      "be disposed to bestow their votes upon merchants and those whom\n",
      "they recommend. We must therefore consider merchants as the natural\n",
      "representatives of all these classes of the community.\n",
      "\n",
      "With regard to the learned professions, little need be observed; they\n",
      "truly form no distinct interest in society, and according to their\n",
      "situation and talents, will be indiscriminately the objects of\n",

      "Nothing remains but the landed interest; and this, in a political view,\n",
      "and particularly in relation to taxes, I take to be perfectly united,\n",
      "from the wealthiest landlord down to the poorest tenant. No tax can be\n",
      "laid on land which will not affect the proprietor of millions of acres\n",
      "as well as the proprietor of a single acre. Every landholder will\n",
      "therefore have a common interest to keep the taxes on land as low as\n",
      "possible; and common interest may always be reckoned upon as the surest\n",
      "bond of sympathy. But if we even could suppose a distinction of interest\n",
      "between the opulent landholder and the middling farmer, what reason is\n",

      "deputed to the national legislature than the last? If we take fact as\n",
      "our guide, and look into our own senate and assembly, we shall find that\n",
      "moderate proprietors of land prevail in both; nor is this less the case\n",
      "in the senate, which consists of a smaller number, than in the assembly,\n",
      "which is composed of a greater number. Where the qualifications of the\n",

      "that the interests and feelings of the different classes of citizens\n",
      "will not be understood or attended to by these three descriptions of\n",

      "articles of consumption, one is at a loss to conceive what can be the\n",
      "nature of the difficulties apprehended. The knowledge relating to them\n",
      "must evidently be of a kind that will either be suggested by the nature\n",
      "of the article itself, or can easily be procured from any well-informed\n",
      "man, especially of the mercantile class. The circumstances that may\n",
      "distinguish its situation in one State from its situation in another\n",
      "must be few, simple, and easy to be comprehended. The principal thing\n",
      "to be attended to, would be to avoid those articles which had been\n",
      "previously appropriated to the use of a particular State; and there\n",
      "could be no difficulty in ascertaining the revenue system of each. This\n",
      "could always be known from the respective codes of laws, as well as from\n",
      "the information of the members from the several States.\n",
      "\n",
      "The objection, when applied to real property or to houses and lands,\n",
      "appears to have, at first sight, more foundation, but even in this view\n",
      "it will not bear a close examination. Land taxes are commonly laid in\n",
      "one of two modes, either by ACTUAL valuations, permanent or periodical,\n",
      "or by OCCASIONAL assessments, at the discretion, or according to the\n",
      "best judgment, of certain officers whose duty it is to make them. In\n",
      "either case, the EXECUTION of the business, which alone requires the\n",
      "knowledge of local details, must be devolved upon discreet persons in\n",
      "the character of commissioners or assessors, elected by the people or\n",
      "appointed by the government for the purpose. All that the law can do\n",
      "must be to name the persons or to prescribe the manner of their election\n",
      "or appointment, to fix their numbers and qualifications and to draw the\n",
      "general outlines of their powers and duties. And what is there in all\n",
      "this that cannot as well be performed by the national legislature as by\n",
      "a State legislature? The attention of either can only reach to general\n",
      "principles; local details, as already observed, must be referred to\n",
      "those who are to execute the plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there is a simple point of view in which this matter may be placed\n",
      "that must be altogether satisfactory. The national legislature can make\n",
      "use of the SYSTEM OF EACH STATE WITHIN THAT STATE. The method of laying\n",
      "and collecting this species of taxes in each State can, in all its\n",
      "parts, be adopted and employed by the federal government.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let it be recollected that the proportion of these taxes is not to\n",
      "be left to the discretion of the national legislature, but is to be\n",
      "determined by the numbers of each State, as described in the second\n",
      "section of the first article. An actual census or enumeration of the\n",
      "people must furnish the rule, a circumstance which effectually shuts the\n",
      "door to partiality or oppression. The abuse of this power of taxation\n",
      "seems to have been provided against with guarded circumspection. In\n",
      "addition to the precaution just mentioned, there is a provision that\n",
      "\"all duties, imposts, and excises shall be UNIFORM throughout the United\n",
      "States.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It has been very properly observed by different speakers and writers\n",
      "on the side of the Constitution, that if the exercise of the power of\n",
      "internal taxation by the Union should be discovered on experiment to be\n",
      "really inconvenient, the federal government may then forbear the use of\n",
      "it, and have recourse to requisitions in its stead. By way of answer to\n",
      "this, it has been triumphantly asked, Why not in the first instance\n",
      "omit that ambiguous power, and rely upon the latter resource? Two solid\n",
      "answers may be given. The first is, that the exercise of that power, if\n",
      "convenient, will be preferable, because it will be more effectual;\n",
      "and it is impossible to prove in theory, or otherwise than by the\n",
      "experiment, that it cannot be advantageously exercised. The contrary,\n",
      "indeed, appears most probable. The second answer is, that the existence\n",
      "of such a power in the Constitution will have a strong influence in\n",
      "giving efficacy to requisitions. When the States know that the Union\n",
      "can apply itself without their agency, it will be a powerful motive for\n",
      "exertion on their part.\n",
      "\n",
      "As to the interference of the revenue laws of the Union, and of\n",
      "its members, we have already seen that there can be no clashing or\n",
      "repugnancy of authority. The laws cannot, therefore, in a legal sense,\n",
      "interfere with each other; and it is far from impossible to avoid an\n",
      "interference even in the policy of their different systems. An effectual\n",
      "expedient for this purpose will be, mutually, to abstain from those\n",
      "objects which either side may have first had recourse to. As neither can\n",
      "CONTROL the other, each will have an obvious and sensible interest in\n",
      "this reciprocal forbearance. And where there is an IMMEDIATE common\n",
      "interest, we may safely count upon its operation. When the particular\n",
      "debts of the States are done away, and their expenses come to be limited\n",
      "within their natural compass, the possibility almost of interference\n",
      "will vanish. A small land tax will answer the purpose of the States, and\n",
      "will be their most simple and most fit resource.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many spectres have been raised out of this power of internal taxation,\n",
      "to excite the apprehensions of the people: double sets of revenue\n",
      "officers, a duplication of their burdens by double taxations, and the\n",
      "frightful forms of odious and oppressive poll-taxes, have been played\n",
      "off with all the ingenious dexterity of political legerdemain.\n",
      "\n",
      "As to the first point, there are two cases in which there can be no room\n",
      "for double sets of officers: one, where the right of imposing the tax is\n",
      "exclusively vested in the Union, which applies to the duties on imports;\n",
      "the other, where the object has not fallen under any State regulation\n",
      "or provision, which may be applicable to a variety of objects. In other\n",
      "cases, the probability is that the United States will either wholly\n",
      "abstain from the objects preoccupied for local purposes, or will make\n",
      "use of the State officers and State regulations for collecting the\n",
      "additional imposition. This will best answer the views of revenue,\n",
      "because it will save expense in the collection, and will best avoid any\n",
      "occasion of disgust to the State governments and to the people. At\n",
      "all events, here is a practicable expedient for avoiding such an\n",
      "inconvenience; and nothing more can be required than to show that evils\n",
      "predicted to not necessarily result from the plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "As to any argument derived from a supposed system of influence, it is\n",
      "a sufficient answer to say that it ought not to be presumed; but the\n",
      "supposition is susceptible of a more precise answer. If such a spirit\n",
      "should infest the councils of the Union, the most certain road to the\n",
      "accomplishment of its aim would be to employ the State officers as much\n",
      "as possible, and to attach them to the Union by an accumulation of their\n",
      "emoluments. This would serve to turn the tide of State influence into\n",
      "the channels of the national government, instead of making federal\n",
      "influence flow in an opposite and adverse current. But all suppositions\n",
      "of this kind are invidious, and ought to be banished from the\n",
      "consideration of the great question before the people. They can answer\n",
      "no other end than to cast a mist over the truth.\n",
      "\n",
      "As to the suggestion of double taxation, the answer is plain. The wants\n",
      "of the Union are to be supplied in one way or another; if to be done by\n",
      "the authority of the federal government, it will not be to be done by\n",
      "that of the State government. The quantity of taxes to be paid by the\n",
      "community must be the same in either case; with this advantage, if\n",
      "the provision is to be made by the Union that the capital resource of\n",
      "commercial imposts, which is the most convenient branch of revenue, can\n",
      "be prudently improved to a much greater extent under federal than under\n",
      "State regulation, and of course will render it less necessary to recur\n",
      "to more inconvenient methods; and with this further advantage, that as\n",
      "far as there may be any real difficulty in the exercise of the power of\n",
      "internal taxation, it will impose a disposition to greater care in the\n",
      "choice and arrangement of the means; and must naturally tend to make it\n",
      "a fixed point of policy in the national administration to go as far as\n",
      "may be practicable in making the luxury of the rich tributary to the\n",
      "public treasury, in order to diminish the necessity of those impositions\n",
      "which might create dissatisfaction in the poorer and most numerous\n",
      "classes of the society. Happy it is when the interest which the\n",
      "government has in the preservation of its own power, coincides with a\n",
      "proper distribution of the public burdens, and tends to guard the least\n",
      "wealthy part of the community from oppression!\n",
      "\n",
      "As to poll taxes, I, without scruple, confess my disapprobation of them;\n",
      "and though they have prevailed from an early period in those States(1)\n",
      "which have uniformly been the most tenacious of their rights, I\n",
      "should lament to see them introduced into practice under the national\n",
      "government. But does it follow because there is a power to lay them that\n",
      "they will actually be laid? Every State in the Union has power to impose\n",
      "taxes of this kind; and yet in several of them they are unknown in\n",
      "practice. Are the State governments to be stigmatized as tyrannies,\n",
      "because they possess this power? If they are not, with what propriety\n",
      "can the like power justify such a charge against the national\n",
      "government, or even be urged as an obstacle to its adoption? As little\n",
      "friendly as I am to the species of imposition, I still feel a thorough\n",
      "conviction that the power of having recourse to it ought to exist in the\n",
      "federal government. There are certain emergencies of nations, in which\n",
      "expedients, that in the ordinary state of things ought to be forborne,\n",
      "become essential to the public weal. And the government, from the\n",
      "possibility of such emergencies, ought ever to have the option of making\n",
      "use of them. The real scarcity of objects in this country, which may\n",
      "be considered as productive sources of revenue, is a reason peculiar\n",
      "to itself, for not abridging the discretion of the national councils\n",
      "in this respect. There may exist certain critical and tempestuous\n",
      "conjunctures of the State, in which a poll tax may become an inestimable\n",
      "resource. And as I know nothing to exempt this portion of the globe\n",
      "from the common calamities that have befallen other parts of it, I\n",
      "acknowledge my aversion to every project that is calculated to disarm\n",

      "difficulties inherent in the very nature of the undertaking referred to\n",
      "the convention.\n",
      "\n",
      "The novelty of the undertaking immediately strikes us. It has been\n",
      "shown in the course of these papers, that the existing Confederation is\n",
      "founded on principles which are fallacious; that we must consequently\n",
      "change this first foundation, and with it the superstructure resting\n",
      "upon it. It has been shown, that the other confederacies which could\n",

      "principles, and can therefore furnish no other light than that of\n",
      "beacons, which give warning of the course to be shunned, without\n",

      "one must have lain in combining the requisite stability and energy in\n",
      "government, with the inviolable attention due to liberty and to the\n",
      "republican form. Without substantially accomplishing this part of their\n",
      "undertaking, they would have very imperfectly fulfilled the object of\n",
      "their appointment, or the expectation of the public; yet that it could\n",
      "not be easily accomplished, will be denied by no one who is unwilling to\n",
      "betray his ignorance of the subject. Energy in government is essential\n",
      "to that security against external and internal danger, and to that\n",
      "prompt and salutary execution of the laws which enter into the very\n",
      "definition of good government. Stability in government is essential to\n",
      "national character and to the advantages annexed to it, as well as to\n",
      "that repose and confidence in the minds of the people, which are\n",
      "among the chief blessings of civil society. An irregular and mutable\n",
      "legislation is not more an evil in itself than it is odious to the\n",
      "people; and it may be pronounced with assurance that the people of\n",
      "this country, enlightened as they are with regard to the nature, and\n",
      "interested, as the great body of them are, in the effects of good\n",
      "government, will never be satisfied till some remedy be applied to\n",
      "the vicissitudes and uncertainties which characterize the State\n",
      "administrations. On comparing, however, these valuable ingredients with\n",
      "the vital principles of liberty, we must perceive at once the difficulty\n",
      "of mingling them together in their due proportions. The genius of\n",
      "republican liberty seems to demand on one side, not only that all power\n",
      "should be derived from the people, but that those intrusted with it\n",
      "should be kept in independence on the people, by a short duration of\n",
      "their appointments; and that even during this short period the trust\n",
      "should be placed not in a few, but a number of hands. Stability, on\n",
      "the contrary, requires that the hands in which power is lodged should\n",
      "continue for a length of time the same. A frequent change of men will\n",
      "result from a frequent return of elections; and a frequent change of\n",
      "measures from a frequent change of men: whilst energy in government\n",
      "requires not only a certain duration of power, but the execution of it\n",
      "by a single hand.\n",

      "Not less arduous must have been the task of marking the proper line of\n",

      "The experience of ages, with the continued and combined labors of the\n",
      "most enlightened legislatures and jurists, has been equally unsuccessful\n",

      "and intricate discussions, sufficiently denoting the indeterminate\n",
      "limits by which they are respectively circumscribed. All new laws,\n",
      "though penned with the greatest technical skill, and passed on the\n",
      "fullest and most mature deliberation, are considered as more or less\n",
      "obscure and equivocal, until their meaning be liquidated and ascertained\n",
      "by a series of particular discussions and adjudications. Besides the\n",
      "obscurity arising from the complexity of objects, and the imperfection\n",
      "of the human faculties, the medium through which the conceptions of men\n",
      "are conveyed to each other adds a fresh embarrassment. The use of words\n",
      "is to express ideas. Perspicuity, therefore, requires not only that the\n",
      "ideas should be distinctly formed, but that they should be expressed by\n",
      "words distinctly and exclusively appropriate to them. But no language is\n",
      "so copious as to supply words and phrases for every complex idea, or\n",
      "so correct as not to include many equivocally denoting different\n",
      "ideas. Hence it must happen that however accurately objects may be\n",
      "discriminated in themselves, and however accurately the discrimination\n",
      "may be considered, the definition of them may be rendered inaccurate\n",
      "by the inaccuracy of the terms in which it is delivered. And this\n",
      "unavoidable inaccuracy must be greater or less, according to the\n",
      "complexity and novelty of the objects defined. When the Almighty himself\n",
      "condescends to address mankind in their own language, his meaning,\n",
      "luminous as it must be, is rendered dim and doubtful by the cloudy\n",
      "medium through which it is communicated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here, then, are three sources of vague and incorrect definitions:\n",
      "indistinctness of the object, imperfection of the organ of conception,\n",
      "inadequateness of the vehicle of ideas. Any one of these must produce a\n",
      "certain degree of obscurity. The convention, in delineating the boundary\n",

      "full effect of them all.\n",

      "To the difficulties already mentioned may be added the interfering\n",
      "pretensions of the larger and smaller States. We cannot err in supposing\n",
      "that the former would contend for a participation in the government,\n",
      "fully proportioned to their superior wealth and importance; and that the\n",
      "latter would not be less tenacious of the equality at present enjoyed by\n",
      "them. We may well suppose that neither side would entirely yield to the\n",
      "other, and consequently that the struggle could be terminated only by\n",
      "compromise. It is extremely probable, also, that after the ratio\n",

      "a government over individuals. Another admits that it ought to be a\n",

      "sort would be superfluous and misplaced, and that the plan would be\n",
      "unexceptionable but for the fatal power of regulating the times and\n",
      "places of election. An objector in a large State exclaims loudly against\n",
      "the unreasonable equality of representation in the Senate. An objector\n",
      "in a small State is equally loud against the dangerous inequality in\n",

      "a shadow of a representation, and that the government would be far less\n",
      "objectionable if the number and the expense were doubled. A patriot in\n",
      "a State that does not import or export, discerns insuperable objections\n",
      "against the power of direct taxation. The patriotic adversary in a State\n",
      "of great exports and imports, is not less dissatisfied that the whole\n",
      "burden of taxes may be thrown on consumption. This politician discovers\n",
      "in the Constitution a direct and irresistible tendency to monarchy; that\n",
      "is equally sure it will end in aristocracy. Another is puzzled to say\n",
      "which of these shapes it will ultimately assume, but sees clearly it\n",
      "must be one or other of them; whilst a fourth is not wanting, who with\n",
      "no less confidence affirms that the Constitution is so far from having a\n",
      "bias towards either of these dangers, that the weight on that side\n",
      "will not be sufficient to keep it upright and firm against its opposite\n",
      "propensities. With another class of adversaries to the Constitution the\n",
      "language is that the legislative, executive, and judiciary departments\n",
      "are intermixed in such a manner as to contradict all the ideas of\n",
      "regular government and all the requisite precautions in favor of\n",
      "liberty. Whilst this objection circulates in vague and general\n",
      "expressions, there are but a few who lend their sanction to it. Let each\n",
      "one come forward with his particular explanation, and scarce any two are\n",
      "exactly agreed upon the subject. In the eyes of one the junction of the\n",
      "Senate with the President in the responsible function of appointing to\n",
      "offices, instead of vesting this executive power in the Executive alone,\n",
      "is the vicious part of the organization. To another, the exclusion\n",
      "of the House of Representatives, whose numbers alone could be a due\n",
      "security against corruption and partiality in the exercise of such\n",
      "a power, is equally obnoxious. With another, the admission of the\n",
      "President into any share of a power which ever must be a dangerous\n",
      "engine in the hands of the executive magistrate, is an unpardonable\n",
      "violation of the maxims of republican jealousy. No part of the\n",
      "arrangement, according to some, is more inadmissible than the trial of\n",
      "impeachments by the Senate, which is alternately a member both of the\n",

      "that a reference of impeachments to the judiciary authority would be an\n",
      "amendment of the error. Our principal dislike to the organization arises\n",
      "from the extensive powers already lodged in that department.\" Even\n",
      "among the zealous patrons of a council of state the most irreconcilable\n",
      "variance is discovered concerning the mode in which it ought to be\n",

      "no longer a point of speculation and hope, that the Western territory\n",
      "is a mine of vast wealth to the United States; and although it is not of\n",
      "such a nature as to extricate them from their present distresses, or\n",
      "for some time to come, to yield any regular supplies for the public\n",

      "to effect a gradual discharge of the domestic debt, and to furnish, for\n",
      "a certain period, liberal tributes to the federal treasury. A very\n",
      "large proportion of this fund has been already surrendered by individual\n",
      "States; and it may with reason be expected that the remaining States\n",
      "will not persist in withholding similar proofs of their equity and\n",
      "generosity. We may calculate, therefore, that a rich and fertile\n",
      "country, of an area equal to the inhabited extent of the United\n",

      "the convention, we now proceed to the execution of that part of our\n",
      "undertaking.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first question that offers itself is, whether the general form and\n",
      "aspect of the government be strictly republican. It is evident that\n",
      "no other form would be reconcilable with the genius of the people of\n",
      "America; with the fundamental principles of the Revolution; or with that\n",
      "honorable determination which animates every votary of freedom, to\n",

      "\n",
      "What, then, are the distinctive characters of the republican form? Were\n",
      "an answer to this question to be sought, not by recurring to principles,\n",
      "but in the application of the term by political writers, to the\n",
      "constitution of different States, no satisfactory one would ever be\n",
      "found. Holland, in which no particle of the supreme authority is derived\n",
      "from the people, has passed almost universally under the denomination of\n",
      "a republic. The same title has been bestowed on Venice, where absolute\n",
      "power over the great body of the people is exercised, in the most\n",
      "absolute manner, by a small body of hereditary nobles. Poland, which is\n",
      "a mixture of aristocracy and of monarchy in their worst forms, has been\n",
      "dignified with the same appellation. The government of England, which\n",
      "has one republican branch only, combined with an hereditary aristocracy\n",
      "and monarchy, has, with equal impropriety, been frequently placed on\n",
      "the list of republics. These examples, which are nearly as dissimilar\n",
      "to each other as to a genuine republic, show the extreme inaccuracy with\n",
      "which the term has been used in political disquisitions.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we resort for a criterion to the different principles on which\n",
      "different forms of government are established, we may define a republic\n",
      "to be, or at least may bestow that name on, a government which derives\n",
      "all its powers directly or indirectly from the great body of the people,\n",
      "and is administered by persons holding their offices during pleasure,\n",
      "for a limited period, or during good behavior. It is ESSENTIAL to such\n",
      "a government that it be derived from the great body of the society, not\n",
      "from an inconsiderable proportion, or a favored class of it; otherwise\n",
      "a handful of tyrannical nobles, exercising their oppressions by a\n",
      "delegation of their powers, might aspire to the rank of republicans,\n",
      "and claim for their government the honorable title of republic. It is\n",
      "SUFFICIENT for such a government that the persons administering it be\n",
      "appointed, either directly or indirectly, by the people; and that\n",
      "they hold their appointments by either of the tenures just specified;\n",
      "otherwise every government in the United States, as well as every\n",
      "other popular government that has been or can be well organized or well\n",
      "executed, would be degraded from the republican character. According\n",
      "to the constitution of every State in the Union, some or other of the\n",
      "officers of government are appointed indirectly only by the people.\n",
      "According to most of them, the chief magistrate himself is so appointed.\n",
      "And according to one, this mode of appointment is extended to one of\n",
      "the co-ordinate branches of the legislature. According to all the\n",
      "constitutions, also, the tenure of the highest offices is extended to a\n",
      "definite period, and in many instances, both within the legislative and\n",
      "executive departments, to a period of years. According to the provisions\n",
      "of most of the constitutions, again, as well as according to the most\n",
      "respectable and received opinions on the subject, the members of the\n",
      "judiciary department are to retain their offices by the firm tenure of\n",
      "good behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "On comparing the Constitution planned by the convention with the\n",
      "standard here fixed, we perceive at once that it is, in the most rigid\n",
      "sense, conformable to it. The House of Representatives, like that of one\n",
      "branch at least of all the State legislatures, is elected immediately by\n",
      "the great body of the people. The Senate, like the present Congress,\n",
      "and the Senate of Maryland, derives its appointment indirectly from\n",
      "the people. The President is indirectly derived from the choice of the\n",
      "people, according to the example in most of the States. Even the judges,\n",
      "with all other officers of the Union, will, as in the several States,\n",
      "be the choice, though a remote choice, of the people themselves, the\n",
      "duration of the appointments is equally conformable to the republican\n",
      "standard, and to the model of State constitutions The House of\n",
      "Representatives is periodically elective, as in all the States; and for\n",
      "the period of two years, as in the State of South Carolina. The Senate\n",
      "is elective, for the period of six years; which is but one year more\n",
      "than the period of the Senate of Maryland, and but two more than that\n",
      "of the Senates of New York and Virginia. The President is to continue\n",
      "in office for the period of four years; as in New York and Delaware, the\n",
      "chief magistrate is elected for three years, and in South Carolina for\n",
      "two years. In the other States the election is annual. In several of the\n",
      "States, however, no constitutional provision is made for the impeachment\n",
      "of the chief magistrate. And in Delaware and Virginia he is not\n",
      "impeachable till out of office. The President of the United States is\n",
      "impeachable at any time during his continuance in office. The tenure\n",
      "by which the judges are to hold their places, is, as it unquestionably\n",
      "ought to be, that of good behavior. The tenure of the ministerial\n",
      "offices generally, will be a subject of legal regulation, conformably to\n",
      "the reason of the case and the example of the State constitutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Could any further proof be required of the republican complexion of this\n",
      "system, the most decisive one might be found in its absolute prohibition\n",
      "of titles of nobility, both under the federal and the State governments;\n",
      "and in its express guaranty of the republican form to each of the\n",
      "latter.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But it was not sufficient,\" say the adversaries of the proposed\n",
      "Constitution, \"for the convention to adhere to the republican form.\n",
      "They ought, with equal care, to have preserved the FEDERAL form, which\n",
      "regards the Union as a CONFEDERACY of sovereign states; instead of\n",
      "which, they have framed a NATIONAL government, which regards the Union\n",
      "as a CONSOLIDATION of the States.\" And it is asked by what authority\n",
      "this bold and radical innovation was undertaken? The handle which has\n",
      "been made of this objection requires that it should be examined with\n",
      "some precision.\n",
      "\n",
      "Without inquiring into the accuracy of the distinction on which the\n",
      "objection is founded, it will be necessary to a just estimate of its\n",
      "force, first, to ascertain the real character of the government in\n",
      "question; secondly, to inquire how far the convention were authorized\n",
      "to propose such a government; and thirdly, how far the duty they owed to\n",
      "their country could supply any defect of regular authority.\n",
      "\n",
      "First. In order to ascertain the real character of the government, it\n",
      "may be considered in relation to the foundation on which it is to be\n",
      "established; to the sources from which its ordinary powers are to be\n",
      "drawn; to the operation of those powers; to the extent of them; and\n",
      "to the authority by which future changes in the government are to be\n",
      "introduced.\n",
      "\n",
      "On examining the first relation, it appears, on one hand, that the\n",
      "Constitution is to be founded on the assent and ratification of the\n",
      "people of America, given by deputies elected for the special purpose;\n",
      "but, on the other, that this assent and ratification is to be given\n",
      "by the people, not as individuals composing one entire nation, but as\n",
      "composing the distinct and independent States to which they respectively\n",
      "belong. It is to be the assent and ratification of the several States,\n",
      "derived from the supreme authority in each State, the authority of the\n",
      "people themselves. The act, therefore, establishing the Constitution,\n",
      "will not be a NATIONAL, but a FEDERAL act.\n",
      "\n",
      "That it will be a federal and not a national act, as these terms are\n",
      "understood by the objectors; the act of the people, as forming so many\n",
      "independent States, not as forming one aggregate nation, is obvious\n",
      "from this single consideration, that it is to result neither from the\n",
      "decision of a MAJORITY of the people of the Union, nor from that of a\n",
      "MAJORITY of the States. It must result from the UNANIMOUS assent of the\n",
      "several States that are parties to it, differing no otherwise from their\n",
      "ordinary assent than in its being expressed, not by the legislative\n",
      "authority, but by that of the people themselves. Were the people\n",
      "regarded in this transaction as forming one nation, the will of the\n",
      "majority of the whole people of the United States would bind the\n",
      "minority, in the same manner as the majority in each State must bind the\n",
      "minority; and the will of the majority must be determined either by a\n",
      "comparison of the individual votes, or by considering the will of the\n",
      "majority of the States as evidence of the will of a majority of the\n",
      "people of the United States. Neither of these rules have been adopted.\n",
      "Each State, in ratifying the Constitution, is considered as a sovereign\n",
      "body, independent of all others, and only to be bound by its own\n",
      "voluntary act. In this relation, then, the new Constitution will, if\n",
      "established, be a FEDERAL, and not a NATIONAL constitution.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next relation is, to the sources from which the ordinary powers of\n",
      "government are to be derived. The House of Representatives will\n",
      "derive its powers from the people of America; and the people will be\n",
      "represented in the same proportion, and on the same principle, as they\n",
      "are in the legislature of a particular State. So far the government is\n",
      "NATIONAL, not FEDERAL. The Senate, on the other hand, will derive its\n",
      "powers from the States, as political and coequal societies; and these\n",
      "will be represented on the principle of equality in the Senate, as they\n",
      "now are in the existing Congress. So far the government is FEDERAL,\n",
      "not NATIONAL. The executive power will be derived from a very compound\n",
      "source. The immediate election of the President is to be made by the\n",
      "States in their political characters. The votes allotted to them are in\n",
      "a compound ratio, which considers them partly as distinct and coequal\n",
      "societies, partly as unequal members of the same society. The eventual\n",
      "election, again, is to be made by that branch of the legislature which\n",
      "consists of the national representatives; but in this particular act\n",
      "they are to be thrown into the form of individual delegations, from\n",
      "so many distinct and coequal bodies politic. From this aspect of the\n",
      "government it appears to be of a mixed character, presenting at least as\n",
      "many FEDERAL as NATIONAL features.\n",
      "\n",
      "The difference between a federal and national government, as it relates\n",
      "to the OPERATION OF THE GOVERNMENT, is supposed to consist in this, that\n",
      "in the former the powers operate on the political bodies composing\n",
      "the Confederacy, in their political capacities; in the latter, on\n",
      "the individual citizens composing the nation, in their individual\n",
      "capacities. On trying the Constitution by this criterion, it falls\n",
      "under the NATIONAL, not the FEDERAL character; though perhaps not so\n",
      "completely as has been understood. In several cases, and particularly in\n",
      "the trial of controversies to which States may be parties, they must\n",
      "be viewed and proceeded against in their collective and political\n",
      "capacities only. So far the national countenance of the government on\n",
      "this side seems to be disfigured by a few federal features. But this\n",
      "blemish is perhaps unavoidable in any plan; and the operation of\n",
      "the government on the people, in their individual capacities, in its\n",
      "ordinary and most essential proceedings, may, on the whole, designate\n",
      "it, in this relation, a NATIONAL government.\n",
      "\n",
      "But if the government be national with regard to the OPERATION of its\n",
      "powers, it changes its aspect again when we contemplate it in relation\n",
      "to the EXTENT of its powers. The idea of a national government involves\n",
      "in it, not only an authority over the individual citizens, but an\n",
      "indefinite supremacy over all persons and things, so far as they are\n",
      "objects of lawful government. Among a people consolidated into one\n",
      "nation, this supremacy is completely vested in the national legislature.\n",
      "Among communities united for particular purposes, it is vested partly\n",
      "in the general and partly in the municipal legislatures. In the former\n",
      "case, all local authorities are subordinate to the supreme; and may be\n",
      "controlled, directed, or abolished by it at pleasure. In the latter, the\n",
      "local or municipal authorities form distinct and independent portions of\n",
      "the supremacy, no more subject, within their respective spheres, to the\n",
      "general authority, than the general authority is subject to them, within\n",
      "its own sphere. In this relation, then, the proposed government cannot\n",
      "be deemed a NATIONAL one; since its jurisdiction extends to certain\n",
      "enumerated objects only, and leaves to the several States a residuary\n",
      "and inviolable sovereignty over all other objects. It is true that in\n",
      "controversies relating to the boundary between the two jurisdictions,\n",
      "the tribunal which is ultimately to decide, is to be established under\n",
      "the general government. But this does not change the principle of the\n",
      "case. The decision is to be impartially made, according to the rules of\n",
      "the Constitution; and all the usual and most effectual precautions\n",
      "are taken to secure this impartiality. Some such tribunal is clearly\n",
      "essential to prevent an appeal to the sword and a dissolution of the\n",
      "compact; and that it ought to be established under the general rather\n",
      "than under the local governments, or, to speak more properly, that it\n",
      "could be safely established under the first alone, is a position not\n",
      "likely to be combated.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we try the Constitution by its last relation to the authority by\n",
      "which amendments are to be made, we find it neither wholly NATIONAL\n",
      "nor wholly FEDERAL. Were it wholly national, the supreme and ultimate\n",
      "authority would reside in the MAJORITY of the people of the Union; and\n",
      "this authority would be competent at all times, like that of a\n",
      "majority of every national society, to alter or abolish its established\n",
      "government. Were it wholly federal, on the other hand, the concurrence\n",
      "of each State in the Union would be essential to every alteration that\n",
      "would be binding on all. The mode provided by the plan of the convention\n",
      "is not founded on either of these principles. In requiring more than\n",
      "a majority, and principles. In requiring more than a majority, and\n",
      "particularly in computing the proportion by STATES, not by CITIZENS, it\n",
      "departs from the NATIONAL and advances towards the FEDERAL character;\n",
      "in rendering the concurrence of less than the whole number of States\n",
      "sufficient, it loses again the FEDERAL and partakes of the NATIONAL\n",
      "character.\n",
      "\n",
      "The proposed Constitution, therefore, is, in strictness, neither a\n",
      "national nor a federal Constitution, but a composition of both. In its\n",
      "foundation it is federal, not national; in the sources from which the\n",
      "ordinary powers of the government are drawn, it is partly federal and\n",
      "partly national; in the operation of these powers, it is national, not\n",
      "federal; in the extent of them, again, it is federal, not national;\n",

      "this government was to be such as would be ADEQUATE TO THE EXIGENCIES\n",

      "From a comparison and fair construction of these several modes of\n",

      "EXIGENCIES OF GOVERNMENT, and OF THE UNION; and to reduce the articles\n",
      "of Confederation into such form as to accomplish these purposes.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are two rules of construction, dictated by plain reason, as\n",
      "well as founded on legal axioms. The one is, that every part of the\n",
      "expression ought, if possible, to be allowed some meaning, and be made\n",
      "to conspire to some common end. The other is, that where the several\n",
      "parts cannot be made to coincide, the less important should give way\n",
      "to the more important part; the means should be sacrificed to the end,\n",
      "rather than the end to the means.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suppose, then, that the expressions defining the authority of the\n",
      "convention were irreconcilably at variance with each other; that a\n",
      "NATIONAL and ADEQUATE GOVERNMENT could not possibly, in the judgment\n",
      "of the convention, be affected by ALTERATIONS and PROVISIONS in the\n",
      "ARTICLES OF CONFEDERATION; which part of the definition ought to have\n",
      "been embraced, and which rejected? Which was the more important, which\n",
      "the less important part? Which the end; which the means? Let the most\n",
      "scrupulous expositors of delegated powers; let the most inveterate\n",
      "objectors against those exercised by the convention, answer these\n",
      "questions. Let them declare, whether it was of most importance to the\n",
      "happiness of the people of America, that the articles of Confederation\n",
      "should be disregarded, and an adequate government be provided, and the\n",
      "Union preserved; or that an adequate government should be omitted, and\n",
      "the articles of Confederation preserved. Let them declare, whether the\n",
      "preservation of these articles was the end, for securing which a reform\n",
      "of the government was to be introduced as the means; or whether the\n",
      "establishment of a government, adequate to the national happiness, was\n",
      "the end at which these articles themselves originally aimed, and to\n",
      "which they ought, as insufficient means, to have been sacrificed.\n",
      "\n",
      "But is it necessary to suppose that these expressions are absolutely\n",
      "irreconcilable to each other; that no ALTERATIONS or PROVISIONS in the\n",
      "articles of the confederation could possibly mould them into a national\n",
      "and adequate government; into such a government as has been proposed by\n",
      "the convention?\n",

      "PROVISIONS therein are also expressly authorized. Here then is a power\n",
      "to change the title; to insert new articles; to alter old ones. Must it\n",
      "of necessity be admitted that this power is infringed, so long as a part\n",
      "of the old articles remain? Those who maintain the affirmative ought at\n",
      "least to mark the boundary between authorized and usurped innovations;\n",
      "between that degree of change which lies within the compass of\n",

      "described its objects with so much latitude, if some SUBSTANTIAL reform\n",
      "had not been in contemplation. Will it be said that the FUNDAMENTAL\n",
      "PRINCIPLES of the Confederation were not within the purview of the\n",
      "convention, and ought not to have been varied? I ask, What are\n",
      "these principles? Do they require that, in the establishment of the\n",
      "Constitution, the States should be regarded as distinct and independent\n",
      "sovereigns? They are so regarded by the Constitution proposed. Do\n",
      "they require that the members of the government should derive their\n",
      "appointment from the legislatures, not from the people of the\n",
      "States? One branch of the new government is to be appointed by these\n",
      "legislatures; and under the Confederation, the delegates to Congress\n",
      "MAY ALL be appointed immediately by the people, and in two States(1) are\n",
      "actually so appointed. Do they require that the powers of the government\n",
      "should act on the States, and not immediately on individuals? In some\n",
      "instances, as has been shown, the powers of the new government will act\n",
      "on the States in their collective characters. In some instances, also,\n",
      "those of the existing government act immediately on individuals. In\n",
      "cases of capture; of piracy; of the post office; of coins, weights, and\n",
      "measures; of trade with the Indians; of claims under grants of land\n",
      "by different States; and, above all, in the case of trials by\n",
      "courts-marshal in the army and navy, by which death may be inflicted\n",
      "without the intervention of a jury, or even of a civil magistrate; in\n",
      "all these cases the powers of the Confederation operate immediately on\n",
      "the persons and interests of individual citizens. Do these fundamental\n",
      "principles require, particularly, that no tax should be levied without\n",
      "the intermediate agency of the States? The Confederation itself\n",
      "authorizes a direct tax, to a certain extent, on the post office. The\n",
      "power of coinage has been so construed by Congress as to levy a tribute\n",
      "immediately from that source also. But pretermitting these instances,\n",
      "was it not an acknowledged object of the convention and the universal\n",
      "expectation of the people, that the regulation of trade should be\n",
      "submitted to the general government in such a form as would render it\n",
      "an immediate source of general revenue? Had not Congress repeatedly\n",
      "recommended this measure as not inconsistent with the fundamental\n",
      "principles of the Confederation? Had not every State but one; had\n",
      "not New York herself, so far complied with the plan of Congress as to\n",
      "recognize the PRINCIPLE of the innovation? Do these principles, in fine,\n",
      "require that the powers of the general government should be limited,\n",
      "and that, beyond this limit, the States should be left in possession\n",
      "of their sovereignty and independence? We have seen that in the new\n",
      "government, as in the old, the general powers are limited; and that the\n",
      "States, in all unenumerated cases, are left in the enjoyment of their\n",
      "sovereign and independent jurisdiction.\n",
      "\n",
      "The truth is, that the great principles of the Constitution proposed\n",
      "by the convention may be considered less as absolutely new, than as\n",
      "the expansion of principles which are found in the articles of\n",
      "Confederation. The misfortune under the latter system has been, that\n",
      "these principles are so feeble and confined as to justify all the\n",
      "charges of inefficiency which have been urged against it, and to require\n",
      "a degree of enlargement which gives to the new system the aspect of an\n",
      "entire transformation of the old.\n",
      "\n",
      "In one particular it is admitted that the convention have departed from\n",
      "the tenor of their commission. Instead of reporting a plan requiring the\n",
      "confirmation OF THE LEGISLATURES OF ALL THE STATES, they have reported\n",
      "a plan which is to be confirmed by the PEOPLE, and may be carried into\n",
      "effect by NINE STATES ONLY. It is worthy of remark that this objection,\n",
      "though the most plausible, has been the least urged in the publications\n",
      "which have swarmed against the convention. The forbearance can only have\n",
      "proceeded from an irresistible conviction of the absurdity of subjecting\n",
      "the fate of twelve States to the perverseness or corruption of a\n",
      "thirteenth; from the example of inflexible opposition given by a\n",
      "MAJORITY of one sixtieth of the people of America to a measure approved\n",
      "and called for by the voice of twelve States, comprising fifty-nine\n",
      "sixtieths of the people an example still fresh in the memory and\n",
      "indignation of every citizen who has felt for the wounded honor and\n",
      "prosperity of his country. As this objection, therefore, has been in a\n",
      "manner waived by those who have criticised the powers of the convention,\n",
      "I dismiss it without further observation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The THIRD point to be inquired into is, how far considerations of duty\n",
      "arising out of the case itself could have supplied any defect of regular\n",
      "authority.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the preceding inquiries the powers of the convention have been\n",
      "analyzed and tried with the same rigor, and by the same rules, as\n",
      "if they had been real and final powers for the establishment of a\n",
      "Constitution for the United States. We have seen in what manner they\n",
      "have borne the trial even on that supposition. It is time now to\n",
      "recollect that the powers were merely advisory and recommendatory; that\n",
      "they were so meant by the States, and so understood by the convention;\n",
      "and that the latter have accordingly planned and proposed a Constitution\n",
      "which is to be of no more consequence than the paper on which it is\n",
      "written, unless it be stamped with the approbation of those to whom\n",
      "it is addressed. This reflection places the subject in a point of view\n",
      "altogether different, and will enable us to judge with propriety of the\n",
      "course taken by the convention.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us view the ground on which the convention stood. It may be\n",
      "collected from their proceedings, that they were deeply and unanimously\n",
      "impressed with the crisis, which had led their country almost with one\n",
      "voice to make so singular and solemn an experiment for correcting the\n",
      "errors of a system by which this crisis had been produced; that they\n",
      "were no less deeply and unanimously convinced that such a reform as they\n",
      "have proposed was absolutely necessary to effect the purposes of\n",
      "their appointment. It could not be unknown to them that the hopes\n",
      "and expectations of the great body of citizens, throughout this great\n",
      "empire, were turned with the keenest anxiety to the event of their\n",
      "deliberations. They had every reason to believe that the contrary\n",
      "sentiments agitated the minds and bosoms of every external and internal\n",
      "foe to the liberty and prosperity of the United States. They had seen in\n",
      "the origin and progress of the experiment, the alacrity with which\n",
      "the PROPOSITION, made by a single State (Virginia), towards a partial\n",
      "amendment of the Confederation, had been attended to and promoted. They\n",
      "had seen the LIBERTY ASSUMED by a VERY FEW deputies from a VERY FEW\n",
      "States, convened at Annapolis, of recommending a great and critical\n",
      "object, wholly foreign to their commission, not only justified by the\n",
      "public opinion, but actually carried into effect by twelve out of the\n",
      "thirteen States. They had seen, in a variety of instances, assumptions\n",
      "by Congress, not only of recommendatory, but of operative, powers,\n",
      "warranted, in the public estimation, by occasions and objects infinitely\n",
      "less urgent than those by which their conduct was to be governed.\n",
      "They must have reflected, that in all great changes of established\n",
      "governments, forms ought to give way to substance; that a rigid\n",
      "adherence in such cases to the former, would render nominal and nugatory\n",
      "the transcendent and precious right of the people to \"abolish or alter\n",
      "their governments as to them shall seem most likely to effect their\n",
      "safety and happiness,\"(2) since it is impossible for the people\n",
      "spontaneously and universally to move in concert towards their object;\n",
      "and it is therefore essential that such changes be instituted by some\n",
      "INFORMAL AND UNAUTHORIZED PROPOSITIONS, made by some patriotic and\n",
      "respectable citizen or number of citizens. They must have recollected\n",
      "that it was by this irregular and assumed privilege of proposing to the\n",
      "people plans for their safety and happiness, that the States were first\n",
      "united against the danger with which they were threatened by their\n",
      "ancient government; that committees and congresses were formed for\n",
      "concentrating their efforts and defending their rights; and that\n",
      "CONVENTIONS were ELECTED in THE SEVERAL STATES for establishing the\n",
      "constitutions under which they are now governed; nor could it have been\n",
      "forgotten that no little ill-timed scruples, no zeal for adhering\n",
      "to ordinary forms, were anywhere seen, except in those who wished\n",
      "to indulge, under these masks, their secret enmity to the substance\n",
      "contended for. They must have borne in mind, that as the plan to be\n",
      "framed and proposed was to be submitted TO THE PEOPLE THEMSELVES, the\n",
      "disapprobation of this supreme authority would destroy it forever; its\n",
      "approbation blot out antecedent errors and irregularities. It might\n",
      "even have occurred to them, that where a disposition to cavil prevailed,\n",
      "their neglect to execute the degree of power vested in them, and still\n",
      "more their recommendation of any measure whatever, not warranted\n",
      "by their commission, would not less excite animadversion, than a\n",
      "recommendation at once of a measure fully commensurate to the national\n",
      "exigencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Had the convention, under all these impressions, and in the midst of all\n",
      "these considerations, instead of exercising a manly confidence in their\n",
      "country, by whose confidence they had been so peculiarly distinguished,\n",
      "and of pointing out a system capable, in their judgment, of securing\n",
      "its happiness, taken the cold and sullen resolution of disappointing\n",
      "its ardent hopes, of sacrificing substance to forms, of committing the\n",
      "dearest interests of their country to the uncertainties of delay and\n",

      "elevated conception, who can awaken in his bosom one patriotic emotion,\n",
      "what judgment ought to have been pronounced by the impartial world, by\n",
      "the friends of mankind, by every virtuous citizen, on the conduct and\n",
      "character of this assembly? Or if there be a man whose propensity to\n",
      "condemn is susceptible of no control, let me then ask what sentence he\n",
      "has in reserve for the twelve States who USURPED THE POWER of\n",
      "sending deputies to the convention, a body utterly unknown to their\n",
      "constitutions; for Congress, who recommended the appointment of this\n",
      "body, equally unknown to the Confederation; and for the State of New\n",

      "granted for a moment that the convention were neither authorized\n",
      "by their commission, nor justified by circumstances in proposing a\n",

      "precept, it be lawful to accept good advice even from an enemy, shall we\n",

      "\n",
      "THE Constitution proposed by the convention may be considered under\n",
      "two general points of view. The FIRST relates to the sum or quantity of\n",
      "power which it vests in the government, including the restraints\n",
      "imposed on the States. The SECOND, to the particular structure of\n",
      "the government, and the distribution of this power among its several\n",
      "branches.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under the FIRST view of the subject, two important questions arise: 1.\n",
      "Whether any part of the powers transferred to the general government be\n",
      "unnecessary or improper? 2. Whether the entire mass of them be dangerous\n",
      "to the portion of jurisdiction left in the several States?\n",
      "\n",
      "Is the aggregate power of the general government greater than ought to\n",
      "have been vested in it? This is the FIRST question.\n",
      "\n",
      "It cannot have escaped those who have attended with candor to the\n",
      "arguments employed against the extensive powers of the government, that\n",
      "the authors of them have very little considered how far these powers\n",
      "were necessary means of attaining a necessary end. They have chosen\n",
      "rather to dwell on the inconveniences which must be unavoidably blended\n",
      "with all political advantages; and on the possible abuses which must be\n",
      "incident to every power or trust, of which a beneficial use can be made.\n",
      "This method of handling the subject cannot impose on the good sense of\n",
      "the people of America. It may display the subtlety of the writer; it may\n",
      "open a boundless field for rhetoric and declamation; it may inflame\n",
      "the passions of the unthinking, and may confirm the prejudices of the\n",
      "misthinking: but cool and candid people will at once reflect, that the\n",
      "purest of human blessings must have a portion of alloy in them; that the\n",
      "choice must always be made, if not of the lesser evil, at least of the\n",
      "GREATER, not the PERFECT, good; and that in every political institution,\n",
      "a power to advance the public happiness involves a discretion which may\n",
      "be misapplied and abused. They will see, therefore, that in all cases\n",
      "where power is to be conferred, the point first to be decided is,\n",
      "whether such a power be necessary to the public good; as the next will\n",
      "be, in case of an affirmative decision, to guard as effectually as\n",
      "possible against a perversion of the power to the public detriment.\n",
      "\n",
      "That we may form a correct judgment on this subject, it will be proper\n",
      "to review the several powers conferred on the government of the Union;\n",
      "and that this may be the more conveniently done they may be reduced into\n",
      "different classes as they relate to the following different objects: 1.\n",
      "Security against foreign danger; 2. Regulation of the intercourse with\n",
      "foreign nations; 3. Maintenance of harmony and proper intercourse among\n",
      "the States; 4. Certain miscellaneous objects of general utility; 5.\n",
      "Restraint of the States from certain injurious acts; 6. Provisions for\n",
      "giving due efficacy to all these powers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The powers falling within the FIRST class are those of declaring war\n",
      "and granting letters of marque; of providing armies and fleets; of\n",

      "money.\n",

      "of foreign coin; to provide for the punishment of counterfeiting the\n",

      "The defect of power in the existing Confederacy to regulate the commerce\n",
      "between its several members, is in the number of those which have been\n",
      "clearly pointed out by experience. To the proofs and remarks which\n",
      "former papers have brought into view on this subject, it may be added\n",
      "that without this supplemental provision, the great and essential\n",
      "power of regulating foreign commerce would have been incomplete and\n",
      "ineffectual. A very material object of this power was the relief of the\n",
      "States which import and export through other States, from the improper\n",
      "contributions levied on them by the latter. Were these at liberty to\n",
      "regulate the trade between State and State, it must be foreseen that\n",
      "ways would be found out to load the articles of import and export,\n",
      "during the passage through their jurisdiction, with duties which would\n",
      "fall on the makers of the latter and the consumers of the former. We may\n",
      "be assured by past experience, that such a practice would be introduced\n",
      "by future contrivances; and both by that and a common knowledge of human\n",
      "affairs, that it would nourish unceasing animosities, and not improbably\n",
      "terminate in serious interruptions of the public tranquillity. To\n",
      "those who do not view the question through the medium of passion or of\n",
      "interest, the desire of the commercial States to collect, in any form,\n",
      "an indirect revenue from their uncommercial neighbors, must appear not\n",
      "less impolitic than it is unfair; since it would stimulate the injured\n",

      "channels for their foreign trade. But the mild voice of reason, pleading\n",
      "the cause of an enlarged and permanent interest, is but too often\n",
      "drowned, before public bodies as well as individuals, by the clamors of\n",
      "an impatient avidity for immediate and immoderate gain.\n",
      "\n",
      "The necessity of a superintending authority over the reciprocal trade of\n",
      "confederated States, has been illustrated by other examples as well as\n",
      "our own. In Switzerland, where the Union is so very slight, each canton\n",
      "is obliged to allow to merchandises a passage through its jurisdiction\n",
      "into other cantons, without an augmentation of the tolls. In Germany it\n",
      "is a law of the empire, that the princes and states shall not lay tolls\n",
      "or customs on bridges, rivers, or passages, without the consent of\n",
      "the emperor and the diet; though it appears from a quotation in an\n",
      "antecedent paper, that the practice in this, as in many other instances\n",
      "in that confederacy, has not followed the law, and has produced there\n",
      "the mischiefs which have been foreseen here. Among the restraints\n",
      "imposed by the Union of the Netherlands on its members, one is, that\n",

      "The regulation of commerce with the Indian tribes is very properly\n",
      "unfettered from two limitations in the articles of Confederation, which\n",
      "render the provision obscure and contradictory. The power is there\n",
      "restrained to Indians, not members of any of the States, and is not to\n",
      "violate or infringe the legislative right of any State within its own\n",
      "limits. What description of Indians are to be deemed members of a State,\n",
      "is not yet settled, and has been a question of frequent perplexity and\n",
      "contention in the federal councils. And how the trade with Indians,\n",
      "though not members of a State, yet residing within its legislative\n",
      "jurisdiction, can be regulated by an external authority, without so\n",
      "far intruding on the internal rights of legislation, is absolutely\n",
      "incomprehensible. This is not the only case in which the articles\n",
      "of Confederation have inconsiderately endeavored to accomplish\n",
      "impossibilities; to reconcile a partial sovereignty in the Union, with\n",
      "complete sovereignty in the States; to subvert a mathematical axiom, by\n",
      "taking away a part, and letting the whole remain.\n",
      "\n",
      "All that need be remarked on the power to coin money, regulate the value\n",
      "thereof, and of foreign coin, is, that by providing for this last case,\n",
      "the Constitution has supplied a material omission in the articles of\n",
      "Confederation. The authority of the existing Congress is restrained to\n",
      "the regulation of coin STRUCK by their own authority, or that of the\n",
      "respective States. It must be seen at once that the proposed uniformity\n",
      "in the VALUE of the current coin might be destroyed by subjecting that\n",
      "of foreign coin to the different regulations of the different States.\n",
      "\n",
      "The punishment of counterfeiting the public securities, as well as\n",
      "the current coin, is submitted of course to that authority which is to\n",
      "secure the value of both.\n",
      "\n",
      "The regulation of weights and measures is transferred from the articles\n",
      "of Confederation, and is founded on like considerations with the\n",
      "preceding power of regulating coin.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dissimilarity in the rules of naturalization has long been remarked\n",
      "as a fault in our system, and as laying a foundation for intricate and\n",
      "delicate questions. In the fourth article of the Confederation, it is\n",
      "declared \"that the FREE INHABITANTS of each of these States, paupers,\n",
      "vagabonds, and fugitives from justice, excepted, shall be entitled to\n",
      "all privileges and immunities of FREE CITIZENS in the several States;\n",
      "and THE PEOPLE of each State shall, in every other, enjoy all the\n",
      "privileges of trade and commerce,\" etc. There is a confusion of language\n",
      "here, which is remarkable. Why the terms FREE INHABITANTS are used\n",
      "in one part of the article, FREE CITIZENS in another, and PEOPLE\n",
      "in another; or what was meant by superadding to \"all privileges\n",
      "and immunities of free citizens,\" \"all the privileges of trade and\n",
      "commerce,\" cannot easily be determined. It seems to be a construction\n",
      "scarcely avoidable, however, that those who come under the denomination\n",
      "of FREE INHABITANTS of a State, although not citizens of such State, are\n",
      "entitled, in every other State, to all the privileges of FREE CITIZENS\n",
      "of the latter; that is, to greater privileges than they may be entitled\n",
      "to in their own State: so that it may be in the power of a particular\n",

      "confer the rights of citizenship in other States upon any whom it may\n",
      "admit to such rights within itself, but upon any whom it may allow to\n",
      "become inhabitants within its jurisdiction. But were an exposition of\n",
      "the term \"inhabitants\" to be admitted which would confine the stipulated\n",
      "privileges to citizens alone, the difficulty is diminished only, not\n",
      "removed. The very improper power would still be retained by each State,\n",
      "of naturalizing aliens in every other State. In one State, residence\n",
      "for a short term confirms all the rights of citizenship: in another,\n",
      "qualifications of greater importance are required. An alien, therefore,\n",
      "legally incapacitated for certain rights in the latter, may, by previous\n",
      "residence only in the former, elude his incapacity; and thus the law of\n",
      "one State be preposterously rendered paramount to the law of another,\n",
      "within the jurisdiction of the other. We owe it to mere casualty, that\n",
      "very serious embarrassments on this subject have been hitherto escaped.\n",
      "By the laws of several States, certain descriptions of aliens, who had\n",
      "rendered themselves obnoxious, were laid under interdicts inconsistent\n",
      "not only with the rights of citizenship but with the privilege of\n",
      "residence. What would have been the consequence, if such persons, by\n",
      "residence or otherwise, had acquired the character of citizens under the\n",
      "laws of another State, and then asserted their rights as such, both to\n",
      "residence and citizenship, within the State proscribing them? Whatever\n",
      "the legal consequences might have been, other consequences would\n",
      "probably have resulted, of too serious a nature not to be provided\n",
      "against. The new Constitution has accordingly, with great propriety,\n",
      "made provision against them, and all others proceeding from the defect\n",

      "right to their respective writings and discoveries.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "common law. The right to useful inventions seems with equal reason to\n",
      "belong to the inventors. The public good fully coincides in both cases\n",
      "with the claims of individuals. The States cannot separately make\n",
      "effectual provisions for either of the cases, and most of them have\n",
      "anticipated the decision of this point, by laws passed at the instance\n",
      "of Congress.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. \"To exercise exclusive legislation, in all cases whatsoever, over\n",
      "such district (not exceeding ten miles square) as may, by cession of\n",
      "particular States and the acceptance of Congress, become the seat of the\n",
      "government of the United States; and to exercise like authority over\n",
      "all places purchased by the consent of the legislatures of the States in\n",
      "which the same shall be, for the erection of forts, magazines, arsenals,\n",
      "dockyards, and other needful buildings.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The indispensable necessity of complete authority at the seat of\n",
      "government, carries its own evidence with it. It is a power exercised by\n",
      "every legislature of the Union, I might say of the world, by virtue of\n",
      "its general supremacy. Without it, not only the public authority\n",
      "might be insulted and its proceedings interrupted with impunity; but\n",
      "a dependence of the members of the general government on the State\n",
      "comprehending the seat of the government, for protection in the exercise\n",
      "of their duty, might bring on the national councils an imputation of awe\n",
      "or influence, equally dishonorable to the government and dissatisfactory\n",

      "stationary residence of the government would be both too great a public\n",

      "willing parties to the cession; as they will have had their voice in the\n",
      "election of the government which is to exercise authority over them;\n",
      "as a municipal legislature for local purposes, derived from their own\n",
      "suffrages, will of course be allowed them; and as the authority of the\n",

      "The necessity of a like authority over forts, magazines, etc.,\n",
      "established by the general government, is not less evident. The public\n",
      "money expended on such places, and the public property deposited in\n",
      "them, requires that they should be exempt from the authority of the\n",

      "In a confederacy founded on republican principles, and composed of\n",

      "else could the remedy be deposited, than where it is deposited by the\n",
      "Constitution? Governments of dissimilar principles and forms have been\n",
      "found less adapted to a federal coalition of any sort, than those of\n",
      "a kindred nature. \"As the confederate republic of Germany,\" says\n",

      "it had received no higher sanction than a mere legislative ratification.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. \"No State shall enter into any treaty, alliance, or confederation;\n",
      "grant letters of marque and reprisal; coin money; emit bills of credit;\n",
      "make any thing but gold and silver a legal tender in payment of debts;\n",
      "pass any bill of attainder, ex post facto law, or law impairing the\n",
      "obligation of contracts; or grant any title of nobility.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The prohibition against treaties, alliances, and confederations makes\n",
      "a part of the existing articles of Union; and for reasons which need\n",
      "no explanation, is copied into the new Constitution. The prohibition\n",
      "of letters of marque is another part of the old system, but is somewhat\n",
      "extended in the new. According to the former, letters of marque could\n",
      "be granted by the States after a declaration of war; according to the\n",
      "latter, these licenses must be obtained, as well during war as previous\n",
      "to its declaration, from the government of the United States. This\n",
      "alteration is fully justified by the advantage of uniformity in all\n",
      "points which relate to foreign powers; and of immediate responsibility\n",
      "to the nation in all those for whose conduct the nation itself is to be\n",
      "responsible.\n",
      "\n",
      "The right of coining money, which is here taken from the States, was\n",
      "left in their hands by the Confederation, as a concurrent right with\n",
      "that of Congress, under an exception in favor of the exclusive right of\n",
      "Congress to regulate the alloy and value. In this instance, also, the\n",
      "new provision is an improvement on the old. Whilst the alloy and value\n",
      "depended on the general authority, a right of coinage in the particular\n",
      "States could have no other effect than to multiply expensive mints and\n",
      "diversify the forms and weights of the circulating pieces. The latter\n",
      "inconveniency defeats one purpose for which the power was originally\n",
      "submitted to the federal head; and as far as the former might prevent\n",
      "an inconvenient remittance of gold and silver to the central mint for\n",
      "recoinage, the end can be as well attained by local mints established\n",
      "under the general authority.\n",
      "\n",
      "The extension of the prohibition to bills of credit must give pleasure\n",
      "to every citizen, in proportion to his love of justice and his knowledge\n",
      "of the true springs of public prosperity. The loss which America has\n",
      "sustained since the peace, from the pestilent effects of paper money\n",
      "on the necessary confidence between man and man, on the necessary\n",
      "confidence in the public councils, on the industry and morals of the\n",
      "people, and on the character of republican government, constitutes an\n",
      "enormous debt against the States chargeable with this unadvised measure,\n",
      "which must long remain unsatisfied; or rather an accumulation of guilt,\n",
      "which can be expiated no otherwise than by a voluntary sacrifice on the\n",
      "altar of justice, of the power which has been the instrument of it. In\n",
      "addition to these persuasive considerations, it may be observed, that\n",
      "the same reasons which show the necessity of denying to the States the\n",
      "power of regulating coin, prove with equal force that they ought not\n",
      "to be at liberty to substitute a paper medium in the place of coin. Had\n",
      "every State a right to regulate the value of its coin, there might be as\n",
      "many different currencies as States, and thus the intercourse among them\n",
      "would be impeded; retrospective alterations in its value might be made,\n",
      "and thus the citizens of other States be injured, and animosities be\n",
      "kindled among the States themselves. The subjects of foreign powers\n",
      "might suffer from the same cause, and hence the Union be discredited\n",
      "and embroiled by the indiscretion of a single member. No one of these\n",
      "mischiefs is less incident to a power in the States to emit paper money,\n",
      "than to coin gold or silver. The power to make any thing but gold and\n",
      "silver a tender in payment of debts, is withdrawn from the States, on\n",
      "the same principle with that of issuing a paper currency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bills of attainder, ex post facto laws, and laws impairing the\n",
      "obligation of contracts, are contrary to the first principles of the\n",
      "social compact, and to every principle of sound legislation. The two\n",
      "former are expressly prohibited by the declarations prefixed to some of\n",
      "the State constitutions, and all of them are prohibited by the spirit\n",
      "and scope of these fundamental charters. Our own experience has taught\n",
      "us, nevertheless, that additional fences against these dangers ought not\n",
      "to be omitted. Very properly, therefore, have the convention added this\n",
      "constitutional bulwark in favor of personal security and private rights;\n",
      "and I am much deceived if they have not, in so doing, as faithfully\n",
      "consulted the genuine sentiments as the undoubted interests of their\n",
      "constituents. The sober people of America are weary of the fluctuating\n",
      "policy which has directed the public councils. They have seen\n",
      "with regret and indignation that sudden changes and legislative\n",
      "interferences, in cases affecting personal rights, become jobs in the\n",
      "hands of enterprising and influential speculators, and snares to the\n",
      "more-industrious and less-informed part of the community. They have seen,\n",
      "too, that one legislative interference is but the first link of a long\n",
      "chain of repetitions, every subsequent interference being naturally\n",
      "produced by the effects of the preceding. They very rightly infer,\n",
      "therefore, that some thorough reform is wanting, which will banish\n",
      "speculations on public measures, inspire a general prudence and\n",
      "industry, and give a regular course to the business of society. The\n",
      "prohibition with respect to titles of nobility is copied from the\n",
      "articles of Confederation and needs no comment.\n",

      "their imports and exports, and to the United States a reasonable check\n",
      "against the abuse of this discretion. The remaining particulars of this\n",

      "The SIXTH and last class consists of the several powers and provisions\n",
      "by which efficacy is given to all the rest.\n",

      "Constitution would be a dead letter. Those who object to the article,\n",
      "therefore, as a part of the Constitution, can only mean that the FORM\n",
      "of the provision is improper. But have they considered whether a better\n",
      "form could have been substituted?\n",
      "\n",
      "There are four other possible methods which the Constitution might have\n",
      "taken on this subject. They might have copied the second article of the\n",

      "positive enumeration of the powers comprehended under the general terms\n",
      "\"necessary and proper\"; they might have attempted a negative enumeration\n",
      "of them, by specifying the powers excepted from the general definition;\n",
      "they might have been altogether silent on the subject, leaving these\n",
      "necessary and proper powers to construction and inference.\n",
      "\n",
      "Had the convention taken the first method of adopting the second\n",
      "article of Confederation, it is evident that the new Congress would be\n",
      "continually exposed, as their predecessors have been, to the alternative\n",
      "of construing the term \"EXPRESSLY\" with so much rigor, as to disarm the\n",
      "government of all real authority whatever, or with so much latitude as\n",
      "to destroy altogether the force of the restriction. It would be easy to\n",
      "show, if it were necessary, that no important power, delegated by the\n",
      "articles of Confederation, has been or can be executed by Congress,\n",
      "without recurring more or less to the doctrine of CONSTRUCTION or\n",
      "IMPLICATION. As the powers delegated under the new system are more\n",
      "extensive, the government which is to administer it would find itself\n",
      "still more distressed with the alternative of betraying the public\n",
      "interests by doing nothing, or of violating the Constitution by\n",
      "exercising powers indispensably necessary and proper, but, at the same\n",

      "persuaded that the balance is much more likely to be disturbed by the\n",
      "preponderancy of the last than of the first scale.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have seen, in all the examples of ancient and modern confederacies,\n",
      "the strongest tendency continually betraying itself in the members,\n",
      "to despoil the general government of its authorities, with a very\n",
      "ineffectual capacity in the latter to defend itself against the\n",

      "States will retain, under the proposed Constitution, a very extensive\n",
      "portion of active sovereignty, the inference ought not to be wholly\n",
      "disregarded. In the Achaean league it is probable that the federal head\n",
      "had a degree and species of power, which gave it a considerable likeness\n",
      "to the government framed by the convention. The Lycian Confederacy, as\n",
      "far as its principles and form are transmitted, must have borne a still\n",
      "greater analogy to it. Yet history does not inform us that either of\n",
      "them ever degenerated, or tended to degenerate, into one consolidated\n",
      "government. On the contrary, we know that the ruin of one of them\n",
      "proceeded from the incapacity of the federal authority to prevent the\n",
      "dissensions, and finally the disunion, of the subordinate authorities.\n",
      "These cases are the more worthy of our attention, as the external\n",

      "no external dangers enforced internal harmony and subordination, and\n",
      "particularly, had the local sovereigns possessed the affections of the\n",

      "The State governments may be regarded as constituent and essential parts\n",
      "of the federal government; whilst the latter is nowise essential to the\n",
      "operation or organization of the former. Without the intervention of the\n",
      "State legislatures, the President of the United States cannot be elected\n",
      "at all. They must in all cases have a great share in his appointment,\n",
      "and will, perhaps, in most cases, of themselves determine it. The Senate\n",
      "will be elected absolutely and exclusively by the State legislatures.\n",
      "Even the House of Representatives, though drawn immediately from the\n",
      "people, will be chosen very much under the influence of that class of\n",
      "men, whose influence over the people obtains for themselves an election\n",
      "into the State legislatures. Thus, each of the principal branches of the\n",
      "federal government will owe its existence more or less to the favor of\n",
      "the State governments, and must consequently feel a dependence, which\n",
      "is much more likely to beget a disposition too obsequious than too\n",
      "overbearing towards them. On the other side, the component parts of the\n",
      "State governments will in no instance be indebted for their appointment\n",
      "to the direct agency of the federal government, and very little, if at\n",
      "all, to the local influence of its members.\n",
      "\n",
      "The number of individuals employed under the Constitution of the\n",
      "United States will be much smaller than the number employed under the\n",
      "particular States. There will consequently be less of personal influence\n",
      "on the side of the former than of the latter. The members of the\n",
      "legislative, executive, and judiciary departments of thirteen and more\n",
      "States, the justices of peace, officers of militia, ministerial officers\n",
      "of justice, with all the county, corporation, and town officers, for\n",
      "three millions and more of people, intermixed, and having particular\n",
      "acquaintance with every class and circle of people, must exceed, beyond\n",
      "all proportion, both in number and influence, those of every description\n",
      "who will be employed in the administration of the federal system.\n",
      "Compare the members of the three great departments of the thirteen\n",
      "States, excluding from the judiciary department the justices of\n",
      "peace, with the members of the corresponding departments of the single\n",
      "government of the Union; compare the militia officers of three millions\n",
      "of people with the military and marine officers of any establishment\n",
      "which is within the compass of probability, or, I may add, of\n",
      "possibility, and in this view alone, we may pronounce the advantage\n",
      "of the States to be decisive. If the federal government is to have\n",
      "collectors of revenue, the State governments will have theirs also. And\n",
      "as those of the former will be principally on the seacoast, and not very\n",
      "numerous, whilst those of the latter will be spread over the face of the\n",
      "country, and will be very numerous, the advantage in this view also lies\n",
      "on the same side. It is true, that the Confederacy is to possess, and\n",
      "may exercise, the power of collecting internal as well as external taxes\n",
      "throughout the States; but it is probable that this power will not be\n",
      "resorted to, except for supplemental purposes of revenue; that an option\n",
      "will then be given to the States to supply their quotas by previous\n",
      "collections of their own; and that the eventual collection, under\n",
      "the immediate authority of the Union, will generally be made by the\n",
      "officers, and according to the rules, appointed by the several States.\n",
      "Indeed it is extremely probable, that in other instances, particularly\n",
      "in the organization of the judicial power, the officers of the States\n",
      "will be clothed with the correspondent authority of the Union. Should it\n",
      "happen, however, that separate collectors of internal revenue should\n",
      "be appointed under the federal government, the influence of the whole\n",
      "number would not bear a comparison with that of the multitude of State\n",
      "officers in the opposite scale. Within every district to which a federal\n",
      "collector would be allotted, there would not be less than thirty or\n",
      "forty, or even more, officers of different descriptions, and many of\n",
      "them persons of character and weight, whose influence would lie on the\n",
      "side of the State.\n",
      "\n",
      "The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal\n",
      "government, are few and defined. Those which are to remain in the State\n",

      "principally on external objects, as war, peace, negotiation, and foreign\n",

      "the people at large. It was, nevertheless, invariably found, after\n",
      "the transient enthusiasm for the early Congresses was over, that the\n",
      "attention and attachment of the people were turned anew to their own\n",
      "particular governments; that the federal council was at no time the idol\n",

      "of each towards the other may be influenced by these causes, the State\n",
      "governments must clearly have the advantage. But in a distinct and very\n",
      "important point of view, the advantage will lie on the same side. The\n",
      "prepossessions, which the members themselves will carry into the federal\n",

      "rarely happen, that the members of the State governments will carry into\n",
      "the public councils a bias in favor of the general government. A local\n",
      "spirit will infallibly prevail much more in the members of Congress,\n",
      "than a national spirit will prevail in the legislatures of the\n",
      "particular States. Every one knows that a great proportion of the errors\n",
      "committed by the State legislatures proceeds from the disposition of\n",
      "the members to sacrifice the comprehensive and permanent interest of the\n",

      "of their affections and consultations? For the same reason that the\n",
      "members of the State legislatures will be unlikely to attach themselves\n",
      "sufficiently to national objects, the members of the federal legislature\n",
      "will be likely to attach themselves too much to local objects. The\n",

      "of the spirit of both, to be disinclined to invade the rights of the\n",
      "individual States, or the prerogatives of their governments. The motives\n",
      "on the part of the State governments, to augment their prerogatives\n",

      "not be prevented or repaired, if at all, without the employment of means\n",
      "which must always be resorted to with reluctance and difficulty. On the\n",

      "the officers of the Union; the frowns of the executive magistracy of the\n",
      "State; the embarrassments created by legislative devices, which\n",

      "But ambitious encroachments of the federal government, on the authority\n",
      "of the State governments, would not excite the opposition of a single\n",

      "Every government would espouse the common cause. A correspondence would\n",
      "be opened. Plans of resistance would be concerted. One spirit would\n",
      "animate and conduct the whole. The same combinations, in short, would\n",
      "result from an apprehension of the federal, as was produced by the\n",
      "dread of a foreign, yoke; and unless the projected innovations should be\n",
      "voluntarily renounced, the same appeal to a trial of force would be made\n",
      "in the one case as was made in the other. But what degree of madness\n",
      "could ever drive the federal government to such an extremity. In the\n",
      "contest with Great Britain, one part of the empire was employed against\n",
      "the other. The more numerous part invaded the rights of the less\n",
      "numerous part. The attempt was unjust and unwise; but it was not in\n",
      "speculation absolutely chimerical. But what would be the contest in the\n",

      "Extravagant as the supposition is, let it however be made. Let a regular\n",
      "army, fully equal to the resources of the country, be formed; and let\n",
      "it be entirely at the devotion of the federal government; still it would\n",
      "not be going too far to say, that the State governments, with the people\n",
      "on their side, would be able to repel the danger. The highest number to\n",
      "which, according to the best computation, a standing army can be carried\n",
      "in any country, does not exceed one hundredth part of the whole number\n",
      "of souls; or one twenty-fifth part of the number able to bear arms. This\n",
      "proportion would not yield, in the United States, an army of more than\n",
      "twenty-five or thirty thousand men. To these would be opposed a militia\n",
      "amounting to near half a million of citizens with arms in their hands,\n",
      "officered by men chosen from among themselves, fighting for their common\n",
      "liberties, and united and conducted by governments possessing their\n",
      "affections and confidence. It may well be doubted, whether a militia\n",
      "thus circumstanced could ever be conquered by such a proportion of\n",
      "regular troops. Those who are best acquainted with the last successful\n",
      "resistance of this country against the British arms, will be most\n",
      "inclined to deny the possibility of it. Besides the advantage of being\n",
      "armed, which the Americans possess over the people of almost every other\n",
      "nation, the existence of subordinate governments, to which the people\n",
      "are attached, and by which the militia officers are appointed, forms a\n",
      "barrier against the enterprises of ambition, more insurmountable than\n",
      "any which a simple government of any form can admit of. Notwithstanding\n",
      "the military establishments in the several kingdoms of Europe, which are\n",
      "carried as far as the public resources will bear, the governments are\n",
      "afraid to trust the people with arms. And it is not certain, that with\n",
      "this aid alone they would not be able to shake off their yokes. But were\n",
      "the people to possess the additional advantages of local governments\n",
      "chosen by themselves, who could collect the national will and direct the\n",
      "national force, and of officers appointed out of the militia, by these\n",
      "governments, and attached both to them and to the militia, it may be\n",
      "affirmed with the greatest assurance, that the throne of every tyranny\n",
      "in Europe would be speedily overturned in spite of the legions which\n",
      "surround it. Let us not insult the free and gallant citizens of America\n",
      "with the suspicion, that they would be less able to defend the rights of\n",
      "which they would be in actual possession, than the debased subjects\n",
      "of arbitrary power would be to rescue theirs from the hands of their\n",
      "oppressors. Let us rather no longer insult them with the supposition\n",
      "that they can ever reduce themselves to the necessity of making\n",

      "\n",
      "The argument under the present head may be put into a very concise\n",
      "form, which appears altogether conclusive. Either the mode in which\n",
      "the federal government is to be constructed will render it sufficiently\n",
      "dependent on the people, or it will not. On the first supposition, it\n",
      "will be restrained by that dependence from forming schemes obnoxious to\n",
      "their constituents. On the other supposition, it will not possess the\n",

      "mass of power among its constituent parts.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the principal objections inculcated by the more respectable\n",
      "adversaries to the Constitution, is its supposed violation of the\n",
      "political maxim, that the legislative, executive, and judiciary\n",
      "departments ought to be separate and distinct. In the structure of the\n",
      "federal government, no regard, it is said, seems to have been paid to\n",
      "this essential precaution in favor of liberty. The several departments\n",
      "of power are distributed and blended in such a manner as at once to\n",
      "destroy all symmetry and beauty of form, and to expose some of the\n",
      "essential parts of the edifice to the danger of being crushed by the\n",
      "disproportionate weight of other parts.\n",
      "\n",
      "No political truth is certainly of greater intrinsic value, or is\n",
      "stamped with the authority of more enlightened patrons of liberty, than\n",
      "that on which the objection is founded. The accumulation of all powers,\n",
      "legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands, whether of\n",
      "one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, self-appointed, or elective,\n",
      "may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny. Were the\n",
      "federal Constitution, therefore, really chargeable with the accumulation\n",
      "of power, or with a mixture of powers, having a dangerous tendency to\n",
      "such an accumulation, no further arguments would be necessary to inspire\n",
      "a universal reprobation of the system. I persuade myself, however,\n",
      "that it will be made apparent to every one, that the charge cannot\n",
      "be supported, and that the maxim on which it relies has been totally\n",
      "misconceived and misapplied. In order to form correct ideas on this\n",
      "important subject, it will be proper to investigate the sense in which\n",
      "the preservation of liberty requires that the three great departments of\n",
      "power should be separate and distinct.\n",
      "\n",
      "The oracle who is always consulted and cited on this subject is the\n",
      "celebrated Montesquieu. If he be not the author of this invaluable\n",
      "precept in the science of politics, he has the merit at least of\n",
      "displaying and recommending it most effectually to the attention of\n",
      "mankind. Let us endeavor, in the first place, to ascertain his meaning\n",
      "on this point.\n",
      "\n",
      "The British Constitution was to Montesquieu what Homer has been to the\n",
      "didactic writers on epic poetry. As the latter have considered the work\n",
      "of the immortal bard as the perfect model from which the principles and\n",
      "rules of the epic art were to be drawn, and by which all similar works\n",
      "were to be judged, so this great political critic appears to have\n",
      "viewed the Constitution of England as the standard, or to use his own\n",
      "expression, as the mirror of political liberty; and to have delivered,\n",
      "in the form of elementary truths, the several characteristic principles\n",
      "of that particular system. That we may be sure, then, not to mistake his\n",
      "meaning in this case, let us recur to the source from which the maxim\n",
      "was drawn.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the slightest view of the British Constitution, we must perceive that\n",
      "the legislative, executive, and judiciary departments are by no means\n",
      "totally separate and distinct from each other. The executive magistrate\n",
      "forms an integral part of the legislative authority. He alone has the\n",
      "prerogative of making treaties with foreign sovereigns, which, when\n",
      "made, have, under certain limitations, the force of legislative acts.\n",
      "All the members of the judiciary department are appointed by him, can be\n",
      "removed by him on the address of the two Houses of Parliament, and form,\n",
      "when he pleases to consult them, one of his constitutional councils. One\n",
      "branch of the legislative department forms also a great constitutional\n",
      "council to the executive chief, as, on another hand, it is the sole\n",
      "depositary of judicial power in cases of impeachment, and is invested\n",
      "with the supreme appellate jurisdiction in all other cases. The judges,\n",
      "again, are so far connected with the legislative department as often to\n",
      "attend and participate in its deliberations, though not admitted to a\n",
      "legislative vote.\n",
      "\n",
      "From these facts, by which Montesquieu was guided, it may clearly be\n",
      "inferred that, in saying \"There can be no liberty where the legislative\n",
      "and executive powers are united in the same person, or body of\n",
      "magistrates,\" or, \"if the power of judging be not separated from\n",
      "the legislative and executive powers,\" he did not mean that these\n",
      "departments ought to have no PARTIAL AGENCY in, or no CONTROL over, the\n",
      "acts of each other. His meaning, as his own words import, and still more\n",
      "conclusively as illustrated by the example in his eye, can amount to\n",
      "no more than this, that where the WHOLE power of one department is\n",
      "exercised by the same hands which possess the WHOLE power of another\n",
      "department, the fundamental principles of a free constitution are\n",
      "subverted. This would have been the case in the constitution examined\n",
      "by him, if the king, who is the sole executive magistrate, had possessed\n",
      "also the complete legislative power, or the supreme administration of\n",
      "justice; or if the entire legislative body had possessed the supreme\n",
      "judiciary, or the supreme executive authority. This, however, is not\n",
      "among the vices of that constitution. The magistrate in whom the whole\n",
      "executive power resides cannot of himself make a law, though he can put\n",
      "a negative on every law; nor administer justice in person, though he has\n",
      "the appointment of those who do administer it. The judges can exercise\n",
      "no executive prerogative, though they are shoots from the executive\n",
      "stock; nor any legislative function, though they may be advised with\n",
      "by the legislative councils. The entire legislature can perform no\n",
      "judiciary act, though by the joint act of two of its branches the judges\n",
      "may be removed from their offices, and though one of its branches\n",
      "is possessed of the judicial power in the last resort. The entire\n",
      "legislature, again, can exercise no executive prerogative, though one of\n",
      "its branches constitutes the supreme executive magistracy, and another,\n",
      "on the impeachment of a third, can try and condemn all the subordinate\n",
      "officers in the executive department.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reasons on which Montesquieu grounds his maxim are a further\n",
      "demonstration of his meaning. \"When the legislative and executive\n",
      "powers are united in the same person or body,\" says he, \"there can be no\n",
      "liberty, because apprehensions may arise lest THE SAME monarch or senate\n",
      "should ENACT tyrannical laws to EXECUTE them in a tyrannical manner.\"\n",
      "Again: \"Were the power of judging joined with the legislative, the life\n",
      "and liberty of the subject would be exposed to arbitrary control, for\n",
      "THE JUDGE would then be THE LEGISLATOR. Were it joined to the executive\n",
      "power, THE JUDGE might behave with all the violence of AN OPPRESSOR.\"\n",
      "Some of these reasons are more fully explained in other passages; but\n",
      "briefly stated as they are here, they sufficiently establish the meaning\n",
      "which we have put on this celebrated maxim of this celebrated author.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we look into the constitutions of the several States, we find that,\n",
      "notwithstanding the emphatical and, in some instances, the unqualified\n",
      "terms in which this axiom has been laid down, there is not a single\n",
      "instance in which the several departments of power have been kept\n",

      "the last formed, seems to have been fully aware of the impossibility and\n",
      "inexpediency of avoiding any mixture whatever of these departments,\n",
      "and has qualified the doctrine by declaring \"that the legislative,\n",

      "WHOLE FABRIC OF THE CONSTITUTION IN ONE INDISSOLUBLE BOND OF UNITY AND\n",

      "respects. The Senate, which is a branch of the legislative department,\n",
      "is also a judicial tribunal for the trial of impeachments. The\n",
      "President, who is the head of the executive department, is the presiding\n",

      "his council is every year chosen by and from the members of the same\n",

      "never exercise the legislative and judicial powers, or either of them;\n",
      "the judicial shall never exercise the legislative and executive powers,\n",

      "single point violated by the plan of the convention. It goes no farther\n",
      "than to prohibit any one of the entire departments from exercising the\n",
      "powers of another department. In the very Constitution to which it is\n",
      "prefixed, a partial mixture of powers has been admitted. The executive\n",
      "magistrate has a qualified negative on the legislative body, and the\n",

      "department, and removable by the same authority on the address of the\n",
      "two legislative branches. Lastly, a number of the officers of government\n",
      "are annually appointed by the legislative department. As the appointment\n",

      "examined does not require that the legislative, executive, and judiciary\n",
      "departments should be wholly unconnected with each other. I shall\n",
      "undertake, in the next place, to show that unless these departments be\n",

      "will not be denied, that power is of an encroaching nature, and that it\n",
      "ought to be effectually restrained from passing the limits assigned to\n",
      "it. After discriminating, therefore, in theory, the several classes\n",

      "that some more adequate defense is indispensably necessary for the\n",
      "more feeble, against the more powerful, members of the government.\n",
      "The legislative department is everywhere extending the sphere of its\n",
      "activity, and drawing all power into its impetuous vortex.\n",
      "\n",
      "The founders of our republics have so much merit for the wisdom which\n",
      "they have displayed, that no task can be less pleasing than that of\n",
      "pointing out the errors into which they have fallen. A respect for\n",
      "truth, however, obliges us to remark, that they seem never for a moment\n",
      "to have turned their eyes from the danger to liberty from the overgrown\n",
      "and all-grasping prerogative of an hereditary magistrate, supported and\n",
      "fortified by an hereditary branch of the legislative authority. They\n",
      "seem never to have recollected the danger from legislative usurpations,\n",
      "which, by assembling all power in the same hands, must lead to the same\n",
      "tyranny as is threatened by executive usurpations.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a government where numerous and extensive prerogatives are placed\n",
      "in the hands of an hereditary monarch, the executive department is\n",
      "very justly regarded as the source of danger, and watched with all the\n",
      "jealousy which a zeal for liberty ought to inspire. In a democracy,\n",
      "where a multitude of people exercise in person the legislative\n",
      "functions, and are continually exposed, by their incapacity for regular\n",
      "deliberation and concerted measures, to the ambitious intrigues of\n",
      "their executive magistrates, tyranny may well be apprehended, on\n",
      "some favorable emergency, to start up in the same quarter. But in a\n",
      "representative republic, where the executive magistracy is carefully\n",
      "limited; both in the extent and the duration of its power; and where the\n",
      "legislative power is exercised by an assembly, which is inspired, by a\n",
      "supposed influence over the people, with an intrepid confidence in its\n",
      "own strength; which is sufficiently numerous to feel all the passions\n",
      "which actuate a multitude, yet not so numerous as to be incapable of\n",
      "pursuing the objects of its passions, by means which reason prescribes;\n",
      "it is against the enterprising ambition of this department that the\n",
      "people ought to indulge all their jealousy and exhaust all their\n",
      "precautions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The legislative department derives a superiority in our governments\n",
      "from other circumstances. Its constitutional powers being at once more\n",
      "extensive, and less susceptible of precise limits, it can, with the\n",
      "greater facility, mask, under complicated and indirect measures, the\n",
      "encroachments which it makes on the co-ordinate departments. It is not\n",
      "unfrequently a question of real nicety in legislative bodies, whether\n",
      "the operation of a particular measure will, or will not, extend beyond\n",
      "the legislative sphere. On the other side, the executive power being\n",
      "restrained within a narrower compass, and being more simple in its\n",
      "nature, and the judiciary being described by landmarks still less\n",
      "uncertain, projects of usurpation by either of these departments would\n",
      "immediately betray and defeat themselves. Nor is this all: as the\n",
      "legislative department alone has access to the pockets of the people,\n",
      "and has in some constitutions full discretion, and in all a prevailing\n",
      "influence, over the pecuniary rewards of those who fill the other\n",
      "departments, a dependence is thus created in the latter, which gives\n",
      "still greater facility to encroachments of the former.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have appealed to our own experience for the truth of what I advance on\n",
      "this subject. Were it necessary to verify this experience by particular\n",
      "proofs, they might be multiplied without end. I might find a witness\n",
      "in every citizen who has shared in, or been attentive to, the course of\n",
      "public administrations. I might collect vouchers in abundance from the\n",
      "records and archives of every State in the Union. But as a more concise,\n",
      "and at the same time equally satisfactory, evidence, I will refer to the\n",
      "example of two States, attested by two unexceptionable authorities.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first example is that of Virginia, a State which, as we have\n",
      "seen, has expressly declared in its constitution, that the three great\n",
      "departments ought not to be intermixed. The authority in support of it\n",
      "is Mr. Jefferson, who, besides his other advantages for remarking the\n",
      "operation of the government, was himself the chief magistrate of it. In\n",
      "order to convey fully the ideas with which his experience had impressed\n",
      "him on this subject, it will be necessary to quote a passage of some\n",
      "length from his very interesting Notes on the State of Virginia, p. 195.\n",
      "\"All the powers of government, legislative, executive, and judiciary,\n",
      "result to the legislative body. The concentrating these in the same\n",
      "hands, is precisely the definition of despotic government. It will be\n",
      "no alleviation, that these powers will be exercised by a plurality of\n",
      "hands, and not by a single one. One hundred and seventy-three despots\n",
      "would surely be as oppressive as one. Let those who doubt it, turn their\n",
      "eyes on the republic of Venice. As little will it avail us, that they\n",
      "are chosen by ourselves. An ELECTIVE DESPOTISM was not the government we\n",
      "fought for; but one which should not only be founded on free principles,\n",
      "but in which the powers of government should be so divided and balanced\n",
      "among several bodies of magistracy, as that no one could transcend their\n",
      "legal limits, without being effectually checked and restrained by the\n",
      "others. For this reason, that convention which passed the ordinance of\n",
      "government, laid its foundation on this basis, that the legislative,\n",
      "executive, and judiciary departments should be separate and distinct,\n",
      "so that no person should exercise the powers of more than one of them at\n",
      "the same time. BUT NO BARRIER WAS PROVIDED BETWEEN THESE SEVERAL POWERS.\n",
      "The judiciary and the executive members were left dependent on the\n",
      "legislative for their subsistence in office, and some of them for their\n",
      "continuance in it. If, therefore, the legislature assumes executive and\n",
      "judiciary powers, no opposition is likely to be made; nor, if made, can\n",
      "be effectual; because in that case they may put their proceedings into\n",
      "the form of acts of Assembly, which will render them obligatory on the\n",
      "other branches. They have accordingly, IN MANY instances, DECIDED RIGHTS\n",
      "which should have been left to JUDICIARY CONTROVERSY, and THE DIRECTION\n",
      "OF THE EXECUTIVE, DURING THE WHOLE TIME OF THEIR SESSION, IS BECOMING\n",
      "HABITUAL AND FAMILIAR.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The other State which I shall take for an example is Pennsylvania; and\n",
      "the other authority, the Council of Censors, which assembled in the\n",
      "years 1783 and 1784. A part of the duty of this body, as marked out\n",
      "by the constitution, was \"to inquire whether the constitution had been\n",
      "preserved inviolate in every part; and whether the legislative and\n",
      "executive branches of government had performed their duty as guardians\n",
      "of the people, or assumed to themselves, or exercised, other or greater\n",
      "powers than they are entitled to by the constitution.\" In the execution\n",
      "of this trust, the council were necessarily led to a comparison of\n",
      "both the legislative and executive proceedings, with the constitutional\n",
      "powers of these departments; and from the facts enumerated, and to the\n",
      "truth of most of which both sides in the council subscribed, it appears\n",
      "that the constitution had been flagrantly violated by the legislature in\n",
      "a variety of important instances.\n",
      "\n",
      "A great number of laws had been passed, violating, without any apparent\n",
      "necessity, the rule requiring that all bills of a public nature shall be\n",
      "previously printed for the consideration of the people; although this\n",
      "is one of the precautions chiefly relied on by the constitution against\n",
      "improper acts of legislature.\n",
      "\n",
      "The constitutional trial by jury had been violated, and powers assumed\n",
      "which had not been delegated by the constitution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Executive powers had been usurped.\n",
      "\n",
      "The salaries of the judges, which the constitution expressly requires\n",
      "to be fixed, had been occasionally varied; and cases belonging to the\n",
      "judiciary department frequently drawn within legislative cognizance and\n",
      "determination.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those who wish to see the several particulars falling under each of\n",
      "these heads, may consult the journals of the council, which are in\n",
      "print. Some of them, it will be found, may be imputable to peculiar\n",
      "circumstances connected with the war; but the greater part of them\n",
      "may be considered as the spontaneous shoots of an ill-constituted\n",
      "government.\n",
      "\n",
      "It appears, also, that the executive department had not been innocent\n",
      "of frequent breaches of the constitution. There are three observations,\n",
      "however, which ought to be made on this head: FIRST, a great proportion\n",
      "of the instances were either immediately produced by the necessities of\n",
      "the war, or recommended by Congress or the commander-in-chief; SECOND,\n",
      "in most of the other instances, they conformed either to the declared or\n",
      "the known sentiments of the legislative department; THIRD, the executive\n",
      "department of Pennsylvania is distinguished from that of the other\n",
      "States by the number of members composing it. In this respect, it has as\n",
      "much affinity to a legislative assembly as to an executive council. And\n",
      "being at once exempt from the restraint of an individual responsibility\n",
      "for the acts of the body, and deriving confidence from mutual example\n",
      "and joint influence, unauthorized measures would, of course, be more\n",
      "freely hazarded, than where the executive department is administered by\n",
      "a single hand, or by a few hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "The conclusion which I am warranted in drawing from these observations\n",
      "is, that a mere demarcation on parchment of the constitutional limits\n",
      "of the several departments, is not a sufficient guard against those\n",

      "last paper, has subjoined to that valuable work the draught of a\n",
      "constitution, which had been prepared in order to be laid before a\n",
      "convention, expected to be called in 1783, by the legislature, for the\n",
      "establishment of a constitution for that commonwealth. The plan, like\n",
      "every thing from the same pen, marks a turn of thinking, original,\n",
      "comprehensive, and accurate; and is the more worthy of attention as it\n",
      "equally displays a fervent attachment to republican government and an\n",
      "enlightened view of the dangerous propensities against which it ought\n",
      "to be guarded. One of the precautions which he proposes, and on which he\n",
      "appears ultimately to rely as a palladium to the weaker departments of\n",
      "power against the invasions of the stronger, is perhaps altogether\n",
      "his own, and as it immediately relates to the subject of our present\n",
      "inquiry, ought not to be overlooked.\n",
      "\n",
      "His proposition is, \"that whenever any two of the three branches of\n",
      "government shall concur in opinion, each by the voices of two thirds\n",
      "of their whole number, that a convention is necessary for altering the\n",
      "constitution, or CORRECTING BREACHES OF IT, a convention shall be called\n",
      "for the purpose.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As the people are the only legitimate fountain of power, and it is from\n",
      "them that the constitutional charter, under which the several branches\n",
      "of government hold their power, is derived, it seems strictly consonant\n",
      "to the republican theory, to recur to the same original authority, not\n",
      "only whenever it may be necessary to enlarge, diminish, or new-model the\n",
      "powers of the government, but also whenever any one of the departments\n",
      "may commit encroachments on the chartered authorities of the others. The\n",
      "several departments being perfectly co-ordinate by the terms of their\n",
      "common commission, none of them, it is evident, can pretend to an\n",
      "exclusive or superior right of settling the boundaries between their\n",
      "respective powers; and how are the encroachments of the stronger to\n",
      "be prevented, or the wrongs of the weaker to be redressed, without\n",
      "an appeal to the people themselves, who, as the grantors of the\n",
      "commissions, can alone declare its true meaning, and enforce its\n",
      "observance?\n",
      "\n",
      "There is certainly great force in this reasoning, and it must be allowed\n",
      "to prove that a constitutional road to the decision of the people ought\n",
      "to be marked out and kept open, for certain great and extraordinary\n",
      "occasions. But there appear to be insuperable objections against the\n",
      "proposed recurrence to the people, as a provision in all cases for\n",
      "keeping the several departments of power within their constitutional\n",
      "limits.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first place, the provision does not reach the case of a\n",
      "combination of two of the departments against the third. If the\n",
      "legislative authority, which possesses so many means of operating on the\n",
      "motives of the other departments, should be able to gain to its interest\n",
      "either of the others, or even one third of its members, the remaining\n",
      "department could derive no advantage from its remedial provision. I do\n",
      "not dwell, however, on this objection, because it may be thought to\n",
      "be rather against the modification of the principle, than against the\n",
      "principle itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the next place, it may be considered as an objection inherent in the\n",
      "principle, that as every appeal to the people would carry an implication\n",
      "of some defect in the government, frequent appeals would, in a great\n",
      "measure, deprive the government of that veneration which time bestows on\n",
      "every thing, and without which perhaps the wisest and freest governments\n",
      "would not possess the requisite stability. If it be true that all\n",
      "governments rest on opinion, it is no less true that the strength of\n",
      "opinion in each individual, and its practical influence on his conduct,\n",
      "depend much on the number which he supposes to have entertained the same\n",
      "opinion. The reason of man, like man himself, is timid and cautious when\n",
      "left alone, and acquires firmness and confidence in proportion to the\n",
      "number with which it is associated. When the examples which fortify\n",
      "opinion are ANCIENT as well as NUMEROUS, they are known to have a double\n",
      "effect. In a nation of philosophers, this consideration ought to be\n",
      "disregarded. A reverence for the laws would be sufficiently inculcated\n",
      "by the voice of an enlightened reason. But a nation of philosophers is\n",
      "as little to be expected as the philosophical race of kings wished for\n",
      "by Plato. And in every other nation, the most rational government\n",
      "will not find it a superfluous advantage to have the prejudices of the\n",
      "community on its side.\n",
      "\n",
      "The danger of disturbing the public tranquillity by interesting too\n",
      "strongly the public passions, is a still more serious objection against\n",
      "a frequent reference of constitutional questions to the decision of\n",
      "the whole society. Notwithstanding the success which has attended the\n",
      "revisions of our established forms of government, and which does so much\n",
      "honor to the virtue and intelligence of the people of America, it must\n",
      "be confessed that the experiments are of too ticklish a nature to be\n",
      "unnecessarily multiplied. We are to recollect that all the existing\n",
      "constitutions were formed in the midst of a danger which repressed\n",
      "the passions most unfriendly to order and concord; of an enthusiastic\n",
      "confidence of the people in their patriotic leaders, which stifled\n",
      "the ordinary diversity of opinions on great national questions; of a\n",
      "universal ardor for new and opposite forms, produced by a universal\n",
      "resentment and indignation against the ancient government; and whilst no\n",
      "spirit of party connected with the changes to be made, or the abuses\n",
      "to be reformed, could mingle its leaven in the operation. The future\n",
      "situations in which we must expect to be usually placed, do not present\n",
      "any equivalent security against the danger which is apprehended.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the greatest objection of all is, that the decisions which would\n",
      "probably result from such appeals would not answer the purpose of\n",
      "maintaining the constitutional equilibrium of the government. We have\n",
      "seen that the tendency of republican governments is to an aggrandizement\n",
      "of the legislative at the expense of the other departments. The appeals\n",
      "to the people, therefore, would usually be made by the executive and\n",
      "judiciary departments. But whether made by one side or the other,\n",
      "would each side enjoy equal advantages on the trial? Let us view\n",
      "their different situations. The members of the executive and judiciary\n",
      "departments are few in number, and can be personally known to a small\n",
      "part only of the people. The latter, by the mode of their appointment,\n",
      "as well as by the nature and permanency of it, are too far removed\n",
      "from the people to share much in their prepossessions. The former are\n",
      "generally the objects of jealousy, and their administration is always\n",
      "liable to be discolored and rendered unpopular. The members of the\n",
      "legislative department, on the other hand, are numerous. They are\n",
      "distributed and dwell among the people at large. Their connections of\n",
      "blood, of friendship, and of acquaintance embrace a great proportion\n",
      "of the most influential part of the society. The nature of their public\n",
      "trust implies a personal influence among the people, and that they are\n",
      "more immediately the confidential guardians of the rights and liberties\n",
      "of the people. With these advantages, it can hardly be supposed that the\n",
      "adverse party would have an equal chance for a favorable issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the legislative party would not only be able to plead their cause\n",
      "most successfully with the people. They would probably be constituted\n",
      "themselves the judges. The same influence which had gained them an\n",
      "election into the legislature, would gain them a seat in the convention.\n",
      "If this should not be the case with all, it would probably be the case\n",
      "with many, and pretty certainly with those leading characters, on whom\n",
      "every thing depends in such bodies. The convention, in short, would be\n",
      "composed chiefly of men who had been, who actually were, or who expected\n",
      "to be, members of the department whose conduct was arraigned. They would\n",
      "consequently be parties to the very question to be decided by them.\n",
      "\n",
      "It might, however, sometimes happen, that appeals would be made under\n",
      "circumstances less adverse to the executive and judiciary departments.\n",
      "The usurpations of the legislature might be so flagrant and so sudden,\n",
      "as to admit of no specious coloring. A strong party among themselves\n",
      "might take side with the other branches. The executive power might be\n",
      "in the hands of a peculiar favorite of the people. In such a posture of\n",
      "things, the public decision might be less swayed by prepossessions in\n",
      "favor of the legislative party. But still it could never be expected\n",
      "to turn on the true merits of the question. It would inevitably be\n",
      "connected with the spirit of pre-existing parties, or of parties\n",
      "springing out of the question itself. It would be connected with persons\n",
      "of distinguished character and extensive influence in the community. It\n",
      "would be pronounced by the very men who had been agents in, or opponents\n",
      "of, the measures to which the decision would relate. The PASSIONS,\n",
      "therefore, not the REASON, of the public would sit in judgment. But it\n",
      "is the reason, alone, of the public, that ought to control and regulate\n",
      "the government. The passions ought to be controlled and regulated by the\n",
      "government.\n",
      "\n",
      "We found in the last paper, that mere declarations in the written\n",
      "constitution are not sufficient to restrain the several departments\n",
      "within their legal rights. It appears in this, that occasional appeals\n",
      "to the people would be neither a proper nor an effectual provision for\n",
      "that purpose. How far the provisions of a different nature contained in\n",
      "the plan above quoted might be adequate, I do not examine. Some of them\n",
      "are unquestionably founded on sound political principles, and all of\n",

      "others may favor a dispassionate review of them, this advantage is\n",
      "inseparable from inconveniences which seem to counterbalance it. In the\n",
      "first place, a distant prospect of public censure would be a very feeble\n",
      "restraint on power from those excesses to which it might be urged by\n",
      "the force of present motives. Is it to be imagined that a legislative\n",
      "assembly, consisting of a hundred or two hundred members, eagerly bent\n",
      "on some favorite object, and breaking through the restraints of the\n",
      "Constitution in pursuit of it, would be arrested in their career, by\n",
      "considerations drawn from a censorial revision of their conduct at the\n",
      "future distance of ten, fifteen, or twenty years? In the next place, the\n",
      "abuses would often have completed their mischievous effects before the\n",
      "remedial provision would be applied. And in the last place, where this\n",
      "might not be the case, they would be of long standing, would have taken\n",
      "deep root, and would not easily be extirpated.\n",
      "\n",
      "The scheme of revising the constitution, in order to correct recent\n",
      "breaches of it, as well as for other purposes, has been actually tried\n",
      "in one of the States. One of the objects of the Council of Censors which\n",
      "met in Pennsylvania in 1783 and 1784, was, as we have seen, to inquire,\n",
      "\"whether the constitution had been violated, and whether the legislative\n",
      "and executive departments had encroached upon each other.\" This\n",
      "important and novel experiment in politics merits, in several points of\n",
      "view, very particular attention. In some of them it may, perhaps, as\n",
      "a single experiment, made under circumstances somewhat peculiar, be\n",
      "thought to be not absolutely conclusive. But as applied to the case\n",
      "under consideration, it involves some facts, which I venture to remark,\n",
      "as a complete and satisfactory illustration of the reasoning which I\n",
      "have employed.\n",
      "\n",
      "First. It appears, from the names of the gentlemen who composed the\n",
      "council, that some, at least, of its most active members had also been\n",
      "active and leading characters in the parties which pre-existed in the\n",
      "State.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second. It appears that the same active and leading members of the\n",
      "council had been active and influential members of the legislative and\n",
      "executive branches, within the period to be reviewed; and even patrons\n",
      "or opponents of the very measures to be thus brought to the test of the\n",
      "constitution. Two of the members had been vice-presidents of the State,\n",
      "and several other members of the executive council, within the seven\n",
      "preceding years. One of them had been speaker, and a number of others\n",
      "distinguished members, of the legislative assembly within the same\n",
      "period.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third. Every page of their proceedings witnesses the effect of all\n",
      "these circumstances on the temper of their deliberations. Throughout\n",
      "the continuance of the council, it was split into two fixed and violent\n",
      "parties. The fact is acknowledged and lamented by themselves. Had\n",
      "this not been the case, the face of their proceedings exhibits a\n",
      "proof equally satisfactory. In all questions, however unimportant\n",
      "in themselves, or unconnected with each other, the same names stand\n",
      "invariably contrasted on the opposite columns. Every unbiased observer\n",
      "may infer, without danger of mistake, and at the same time without\n",
      "meaning to reflect on either party, or any individuals of either party,\n",
      "that, unfortunately, PASSION, not REASON, must have presided over their\n",
      "decisions. When men exercise their reason coolly and freely on a variety\n",
      "of distinct questions, they inevitably fall into different opinions\n",
      "on some of them. When they are governed by a common passion, their\n",
      "opinions, if they are so to be called, will be the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fourth. It is at least problematical, whether the decisions of this body\n",
      "do not, in several instances, misconstrue the limits prescribed for the\n",
      "legislative and executive departments, instead of reducing and limiting\n",
      "them within their constitutional places.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fifth. I have never understood that the decisions of the council on\n",
      "constitutional questions, whether rightly or erroneously formed,\n",
      "have had any effect in varying the practice founded on legislative\n",
      "constructions. It even appears, if I mistake not, that in one instance\n",
      "the contemporary legislature denied the constructions of the council,\n",
      "and actually prevailed in the contest.\n",
      "\n",
      "This censorial body, therefore, proves at the same time, by its\n",
      "researches, the existence of the disease, and by its example, the\n",
      "inefficacy of the remedy.\n",
      "\n",
      "This conclusion cannot be invalidated by alleging that the State in\n",
      "which the experiment was made was at that crisis, and had been for a\n",
      "long time before, violently heated and distracted by the rage of party.\n",
      "Is it to be presumed, that at any future septennial epoch the same State\n",
      "will be free from parties? Is it to be presumed that any other State,\n",
      "at the same or any other given period, will be exempt from them? Such an\n",
      "event ought to be neither presumed nor desired; because an extinction\n",
      "of parties necessarily implies either a universal alarm for the public\n",
      "safety, or an absolute extinction of liberty.\n",

      "the people, to revise the preceding administration of the government,\n",
      "all persons who should have been concerned with the government within\n",
      "the given period, the difficulties would not be obviated. The important\n",
      "task would probably devolve on men, who, with inferior capacities, would\n",
      "in other respects be little better qualified. Although they might not\n",

      "immediately agents in the measures to be examined, they would probably\n",

      "of the principles and structure of the government planned by the\n",
      "convention.\n",

      "In order to lay a due foundation for that separate and distinct exercise\n",
      "of the different powers of government, which to a certain extent is\n",
      "admitted on all hands to be essential to the preservation of liberty,\n",
      "it is evident that each department should have a will of its own; and\n",
      "consequently should be so constituted that the members of each should\n",
      "have as little agency as possible in the appointment of the members of\n",
      "the others. Were this principle rigorously adhered to, it would require\n",
      "that all the appointments for the supreme executive, legislative,\n",
      "and judiciary magistracies should be drawn from the same fountain of\n",
      "authority, the people, through channels having no communication whatever\n",
      "with one another. Perhaps such a plan of constructing the several\n",
      "departments would be less difficult in practice than it may in\n",
      "contemplation appear. Some difficulties, however, and some additional\n",
      "expense would attend the execution of it. Some deviations, therefore,\n",
      "from the principle must be admitted. In the constitution of the\n",
      "judiciary department in particular, it might be inexpedient to insist\n",
      "rigorously on the principle: first, because peculiar qualifications\n",
      "being essential in the members, the primary consideration ought to be\n",
      "to select that mode of choice which best secures these qualifications;\n",
      "secondly, because the permanent tenure by which the appointments are\n",
      "held in that department, must soon destroy all sense of dependence on\n",
      "the authority conferring them.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is equally evident, that the members of each department should be as\n",
      "little dependent as possible on those of the others, for the emoluments\n",
      "annexed to their offices. Were the executive magistrate, or the\n",
      "judges, not independent of the legislature in this particular, their\n",
      "independence in every other would be merely nominal.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the great security against a gradual concentration of the several\n",
      "powers in the same department, consists in giving to those who\n",
      "administer each department the necessary constitutional means and\n",
      "personal motives to resist encroachments of the others. The provision\n",
      "for defense must in this, as in all other cases, be made commensurate to\n",
      "the danger of attack. Ambition must be made to counteract ambition. The\n",
      "interest of the man must be connected with the constitutional rights\n",
      "of the place. It may be a reflection on human nature, that such devices\n",
      "should be necessary to control the abuses of government. But what is\n",
      "government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human nature?\n",
      "If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to\n",
      "govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would\n",
      "be necessary. In framing a government which is to be administered by men\n",
      "over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the\n",
      "government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to\n",
      "control itself. A dependence on the people is, no doubt, the primary\n",
      "control on the government; but experience has taught mankind the\n",
      "necessity of auxiliary precautions.\n",
      "\n",
      "This policy of supplying, by opposite and rival interests, the defect\n",
      "of better motives, might be traced through the whole system of human\n",
      "affairs, private as well as public. We see it particularly displayed in\n",
      "all the subordinate distributions of power, where the constant aim is to\n",
      "divide and arrange the several offices in such a manner as that each may\n",
      "be a check on the other--that the private interest of every individual\n",
      "may be a sentinel over the public rights. These inventions of prudence\n",
      "cannot be less requisite in the distribution of the supreme powers of\n",
      "the State.\n",

      "necessarily predominates. The remedy for this inconveniency is to\n",
      "divide the legislature into different branches; and to render them,\n",
      "by different modes of election and different principles of action, as\n",
      "little connected with each other as the nature of their common functions\n",
      "and their common dependence on the society will admit. It may even be\n",
      "necessary to guard against dangerous encroachments by still further\n",

      "it should be thus divided, the weakness of the executive may require, on\n",
      "the other hand, that it should be fortified. An absolute negative on the\n",
      "legislature appears, at first view, to be the natural defense with\n",
      "which the executive magistrate should be armed. But perhaps it would be\n",
      "neither altogether safe nor alone sufficient. On ordinary occasions it\n",
      "might not be exerted with the requisite firmness, and on extraordinary\n",
      "occasions it might be perfidiously abused. May not this defect of an\n",
      "absolute negative be supplied by some qualified connection between this\n",
      "weaker department and the weaker branch of the stronger department, by\n",
      "which the latter may be led to support the constitutional rights of\n",
      "the former, without being too much detached from the rights of its own\n",
      "department?\n",
      "\n",
      "If the principles on which these observations are founded be just, as\n",
      "I persuade myself they are, and they be applied as a criterion to the\n",
      "several State constitutions, and to the federal Constitution it will be\n",
      "found that if the latter does not perfectly correspond with them, the\n",
      "former are infinitely less able to bear such a test.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are, moreover, two considerations particularly applicable to the\n",
      "federal system of America, which place that system in a very interesting\n",
      "point of view.\n",
      "\n",
      "First. In a single republic, all the power surrendered by the people\n",
      "is submitted to the administration of a single government; and the\n",
      "usurpations are guarded against by a division of the government into\n",
      "distinct and separate departments. In the compound republic of America,\n",
      "the power surrendered by the people is first divided between two\n",
      "distinct governments, and then the portion allotted to each subdivided\n",
      "among distinct and separate departments. Hence a double security arises\n",
      "to the rights of the people. The different governments will control each\n",
      "other, at the same time that each will be controlled by itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second. It is of great importance in a republic not only to guard the\n",
      "society against the oppression of its rulers, but to guard one part of\n",
      "the society against the injustice of the other part. Different interests\n",
      "necessarily exist in different classes of citizens. If a majority\n",
      "be united by a common interest, the rights of the minority will be\n",
      "insecure. There are but two methods of providing against this evil:\n",
      "the one by creating a will in the community independent of the\n",
      "majority--that is, of the society itself; the other, by comprehending in\n",
      "the society so many separate descriptions of citizens as will render an\n",
      "unjust combination of a majority of the whole very improbable, if not\n",
      "impracticable. The first method prevails in all governments possessing\n",
      "an hereditary or self-appointed authority. This, at best, is but a\n",
      "precarious security; because a power independent of the society may as\n",
      "well espouse the unjust views of the major, as the rightful interests\n",
      "of the minor party, and may possibly be turned against both parties. The\n",
      "second method will be exemplified in the federal republic of the United\n",
      "States. Whilst all authority in it will be derived from and dependent\n",
      "on the society, the society itself will be broken into so many parts,\n",
      "interests, and classes of citizens, that the rights of individuals, or\n",
      "of the minority, will be in little danger from interested combinations\n",
      "of the majority. In a free government the security for civil rights must\n",
      "be the same as that for religious rights. It consists in the one case in\n",
      "the multiplicity of interests, and in the other in the multiplicity of\n",
      "sects. The degree of security in both cases will depend on the number of\n",
      "interests and sects; and this may be presumed to depend on the extent\n",
      "of country and number of people comprehended under the same government.\n",
      "This view of the subject must particularly recommend a proper federal\n",
      "system to all the sincere and considerate friends of republican\n",
      "government, since it shows that in exact proportion as the territory of\n",
      "the Union may be formed into more circumscribed Confederacies, or States\n",
      "oppressive combinations of a majority will be facilitated: the best\n",
      "security, under the republican forms, for the rights of every class\n",
      "of citizens, will be diminished: and consequently the stability and\n",
      "independence of some member of the government, the only other security,\n",
      "must be proportionately increased. Justice is the end of government. It\n",
      "is the end of civil society. It ever has been and ever will be pursued\n",
      "until it be obtained, or until liberty be lost in the pursuit. In a\n",
      "society under the forms of which the stronger faction can readily unite\n",
      "and oppress the weaker, anarchy may as truly be said to reign as in a\n",
      "state of nature, where the weaker individual is not secured against the\n",
      "violence of the stronger; and as, in the latter state, even the stronger\n",
      "individuals are prompted, by the uncertainty of their condition, to\n",
      "submit to a government which may protect the weak as well as themselves;\n",
      "so, in the former state, will the more powerful factions or parties be\n",
      "gradually induced, by a like motive, to wish for a government which will\n",
      "protect all parties, the weaker as well as the more powerful. It can be\n",
      "little doubted that if the State of Rhode Island was separated from\n",
      "the Confederacy and left to itself, the insecurity of rights under the\n",
      "popular form of government within such narrow limits would be displayed\n",
      "by such reiterated oppressions of factious majorities that some power\n",
      "altogether independent of the people would soon be called for by the\n",
      "voice of the very factions whose misrule had proved the necessity of\n",
      "it. In the extended republic of the United States, and among the great\n",
      "variety of interests, parties, and sects which it embraces, a coalition\n",
      "of a majority of the whole society could seldom take place on any other\n",
      "principles than those of justice and the general good; whilst there\n",
      "being thus less danger to a minor from the will of a major party, there\n",
      "must be less pretext, also, to provide for the security of the former,\n",
      "by introducing into the government a will not dependent on the latter,\n",
      "or, in other words, a will independent of the society itself. It is no\n",
      "less certain than it is important, notwithstanding the contrary opinions\n",

      "government. I shall begin with the House of Representatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first view to be taken of this part of the government relates to the\n",
      "qualifications of the electors and the elected. Those of the former are\n",
      "to be the same with those of the electors of the most numerous branch of\n",
      "the State legislatures. The definition of the right of suffrage is very\n",
      "justly regarded as a fundamental article of republican government. It\n",

      "this right in the Constitution. To have left it open for the occasional\n",
      "regulation of the Congress, would have been improper for the reason just\n",
      "mentioned. To have submitted it to the legislative discretion of the\n",
      "States, would have been improper for the same reason; and for the\n",
      "additional reason that it would have rendered too dependent on the State\n",
      "governments that branch of the federal government which ought to\n",
      "be dependent on the people alone. To have reduced the different\n",
      "qualifications in the different States to one uniform rule, would\n",
      "probably have been as dissatisfactory to some of the States as it\n",
      "would have been difficult to the convention. The provision made by the\n",
      "convention appears, therefore, to be the best that lay within\n",
      "their option. It must be satisfactory to every State, because it\n",
      "is conformable to the standard already established, or which may be\n",
      "established, by the State itself. It will be safe to the United States,\n",
      "because, being fixed by the State constitutions, it is not alterable by\n",
      "the State governments, and it cannot be feared that the people of the\n",
      "States will alter this part of their constitutions in such a manner as\n",
      "to abridge the rights secured to them by the federal Constitution.\n",
      "\n",
      "The qualifications of the elected, being less carefully and properly\n",
      "defined by the State constitutions, and being at the same time more\n",
      "susceptible of uniformity, have been very properly considered and\n",
      "regulated by the convention. A representative of the United States must\n",
      "be of the age of twenty-five years; must have been seven years a\n",
      "citizen of the United States; must, at the time of his election, be an\n",
      "inhabitant of the State he is to represent; and, during the time of\n",
      "his service, must be in no office under the United States. Under these\n",
      "reasonable limitations, the door of this part of the federal government\n",
      "is open to merit of every description, whether native or adoptive,\n",
      "whether young or old, and without regard to poverty or wealth, or to any\n",
      "particular profession of religious faith.\n",
      "\n",
      "The term for which the representatives are to be elected falls under a\n",
      "second view which may be taken of this branch. In order to decide on\n",
      "the propriety of this article, two questions must be considered: first,\n",
      "whether biennial elections will, in this case, be safe; secondly,\n",
      "whether they be necessary or useful.\n",
      "\n",
      "First. As it is essential to liberty that the government in general\n",
      "should have a common interest with the people, so it is particularly\n",
      "essential that the branch of it under consideration should have an\n",
      "immediate dependence on, and an intimate sympathy with, the people.\n",
      "Frequent elections are unquestionably the only policy by which this\n",
      "dependence and sympathy can be effectually secured. But what particular\n",
      "degree of frequency may be absolutely necessary for the purpose, does\n",
      "not appear to be susceptible of any precise calculation, and must depend\n",
      "on a variety of circumstances with which it may be connected. Let us\n",
      "consult experience, the guide that ought always to be followed whenever\n",
      "it can be found.\n",
      "\n",
      "The scheme of representation, as a substitute for a meeting of the\n",
      "citizens in person, being at most but very imperfectly known to\n",
      "ancient polity, it is in more modern times only that we are to expect\n",
      "instructive examples. And even here, in order to avoid a research too\n",
      "vague and diffusive, it will be proper to confine ourselves to the few\n",
      "examples which are best known, and which bear the greatest analogy\n",
      "to our particular case. The first to which this character ought to be\n",
      "applied, is the House of Commons in Great Britain. The history of\n",
      "this branch of the English Constitution, anterior to the date of Magna\n",
      "Charta, is too obscure to yield instruction. The very existence of\n",
      "it has been made a question among political antiquaries. The earliest\n",
      "records of subsequent date prove that parliaments were to SIT only every\n",
      "year; not that they were to be ELECTED every year. And even these annual\n",
      "sessions were left so much at the discretion of the monarch, that,\n",
      "under various pretexts, very long and dangerous intermissions were often\n",
      "contrived by royal ambition. To remedy this grievance, it was provided\n",
      "by a statute in the reign of Charles II, that the intermissions should\n",
      "not be protracted beyond a period of three years. On the accession of\n",
      "William III, when a revolution took place in the government, the subject\n",
      "was still more seriously resumed, and it was declared to be among the\n",
      "fundamental rights of the people that parliaments ought to be held\n",
      "FREQUENTLY. By another statute, which passed a few years later in the\n",
      "same reign, the term \"frequently,\" which had alluded to the triennial\n",
      "period settled in the time of Charles II, is reduced to a precise\n",
      "meaning, it being expressly enacted that a new parliament shall be\n",
      "called within three years after the termination of the former. The last\n",
      "change, from three to seven years, is well known to have been introduced\n",
      "pretty early in the present century, under an alarm for the Hanoverian\n",
      "succession. From these facts it appears that the greatest frequency of\n",
      "elections which has been deemed necessary in that kingdom, for binding\n",
      "the representatives to their constituents, does not exceed a triennial\n",
      "return of them. And if we may argue from the degree of liberty retained\n",
      "even under septennial elections, and all the other vicious ingredients\n",
      "in the parliamentary constitution, we cannot doubt that a reduction of\n",
      "the period from seven to three years, with the other necessary\n",
      "reforms, would so far extend the influence of the people over their\n",
      "representatives as to satisfy us that biennial elections, under the\n",
      "federal system, cannot possibly be dangerous to the requisite dependence\n",
      "of the House of Representatives on their constituents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elections in Ireland, till of late, were regulated entirely by the\n",
      "discretion of the crown, and were seldom repeated, except on the\n",
      "accession of a new prince, or some other contingent event. The\n",
      "parliament which commenced with George II. was continued throughout his\n",
      "whole reign, a period of about thirty-five years. The only dependence of\n",
      "the representatives on the people consisted in the right of the latter\n",
      "to supply occasional vacancies by the election of new members, and in\n",
      "the chance of some event which might produce a general new election.\n",
      "The ability also of the Irish parliament to maintain the rights of\n",
      "their constituents, so far as the disposition might exist, was extremely\n",
      "shackled by the control of the crown over the subjects of their\n",
      "deliberation. Of late these shackles, if I mistake not, have been\n",
      "broken; and octennial parliaments have besides been established. What\n",
      "effect may be produced by this partial reform, must be left to further\n",
      "experience. The example of Ireland, from this view of it, can throw but\n",
      "little light on the subject. As far as we can draw any conclusion from\n",
      "it, it must be that if the people of that country have been able under\n",
      "all these disadvantages to retain any liberty whatever, the advantage of\n",
      "biennial elections would secure to them every degree of liberty, which\n",
      "might depend on a due connection between their representatives and\n",
      "themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us bring our inquiries nearer home. The example of these States,\n",
      "when British colonies, claims particular attention, at the same time\n",
      "that it is so well known as to require little to be said on it. The\n",
      "principle of representation, in one branch of the legislature at\n",
      "least, was established in all of them. But the periods of election were\n",
      "different. They varied from one to seven years. Have we any reason to\n",
      "infer, from the spirit and conduct of the representatives of the\n",
      "people, prior to the Revolution, that biennial elections would have been\n",
      "dangerous to the public liberties? The spirit which everywhere displayed\n",
      "itself at the commencement of the struggle, and which vanquished the\n",
      "obstacles to independence, is the best of proofs that a sufficient\n",
      "portion of liberty had been everywhere enjoyed to inspire both a sense\n",
      "of its worth and a zeal for its proper enlargement This remark holds\n",
      "good, as well with regard to the then colonies whose elections were\n",
      "least frequent, as to those whose elections were most frequent Virginia\n",
      "was the colony which stood first in resisting the parliamentary\n",
      "usurpations of Great Britain; it was the first also in espousing, by\n",
      "public act, the resolution of independence. In Virginia, nevertheless,\n",
      "if I have not been misinformed, elections under the former government\n",
      "were septennial. This particular example is brought into view, not as\n",
      "a proof of any peculiar merit, for the priority in those instances\n",
      "was probably accidental; and still less of any advantage in SEPTENNIAL\n",
      "elections, for when compared with a greater frequency they are\n",
      "inadmissible; but merely as a proof, and I conceive it to be a very\n",
      "substantial proof, that the liberties of the people can be in no danger\n",
      "from BIENNIAL elections.\n",
      "\n",
      "The conclusion resulting from these examples will be not a little\n",
      "strengthened by recollecting three circumstances. The first is, that the\n",
      "federal legislature will possess a part only of that supreme legislative\n",
      "authority which is vested completely in the British Parliament; and\n",
      "which, with a few exceptions, was exercised by the colonial assemblies\n",
      "and the Irish legislature. It is a received and well-founded maxim, that\n",
      "where no other circumstances affect the case, the greater the power is,\n",
      "the shorter ought to be its duration; and, conversely, the smaller the\n",
      "power, the more safely may its duration be protracted. In the second\n",
      "place, it has, on another occasion, been shown that the federal\n",
      "legislature will not only be restrained by its dependence on its people,\n",
      "as other legislative bodies are, but that it will be, moreover, watched\n",
      "and controlled by the several collateral legislatures, which other\n",
      "legislative bodies are not. And in the third place, no comparison can\n",
      "be made between the means that will be possessed by the more permanent\n",
      "branches of the federal government for seducing, if they should be\n",
      "disposed to seduce, the House of Representatives from their duty to the\n",
      "people, and the means of influence over the popular branch possessed\n",
      "by the other branches of the government above cited. With less power,\n",

      "remarked, that sayings which become proverbial are generally founded in\n",

      "extremes, which afford sufficient latitude for all the variations which\n",
      "may be required by the various situations and circumstances of civil\n",
      "society. The election of magistrates might be, if it were found\n",
      "expedient, as in some instances it actually has been, daily, weekly, or\n",
      "monthly, as well as annual; and if circumstances may require a deviation\n",
      "from the rule on one side, why not also on the other side? Turning our\n",
      "attention to the periods established among ourselves, for the election\n",
      "of the most numerous branches of the State legislatures, we find them by\n",
      "no means coinciding any more in this instance, than in the elections of\n",
      "other civil magistrates. In Connecticut and Rhode Island, the periods\n",
      "are half-yearly. In the other States, South Carolina excepted, they\n",
      "are annual. In South Carolina they are biennial--as is proposed in the\n",
      "federal government. Here is a difference, as four to one, between the\n",
      "longest and shortest periods; and yet it would be not easy to show,\n",
      "that Connecticut or Rhode Island is better governed, or enjoys a greater\n",
      "share of rational liberty, than South Carolina; or that either the one\n",
      "or the other of these States is distinguished in these respects, and by\n",
      "these causes, from the States whose elections are different from both.\n",
      "\n",
      "In searching for the grounds of this doctrine, I can discover but one,\n",
      "and that is wholly inapplicable to our case. The important distinction\n",
      "so well understood in America, between a Constitution established by the\n",
      "people and unalterable by the government, and a law established by the\n",
      "government and alterable by the government, seems to have been little\n",
      "understood and less observed in any other country. Wherever the supreme\n",
      "power of legislation has resided, has been supposed to reside also a\n",
      "full power to change the form of the government. Even in Great Britain,\n",
      "where the principles of political and civil liberty have been most\n",
      "discussed, and where we hear most of the rights of the Constitution, it\n",
      "is maintained that the authority of the Parliament is transcendent and\n",
      "uncontrollable, as well with regard to the Constitution, as the ordinary\n",
      "objects of legislative provision. They have accordingly, in several\n",
      "instances, actually changed, by legislative acts, some of the most\n",
      "fundamental articles of the government. They have in particular, on\n",
      "several occasions, changed the period of election; and, on the\n",

      "elections, but by the same act, continued themselves in place four years\n",
      "beyond the term for which they were elected by the people. An attention\n",

      "\n",
      "\"We subscribe to the doctrine,\" might one of our Southern brethren\n",
      "observe, \"that representation relates more immediately to persons, and\n",
      "taxation more immediately to property, and we join in the application of\n",

      "fact, that slaves are considered merely as property, and in no respect\n",

      "both these qualities: being considered by our laws, in some respects, as\n",
      "persons, and in other respects as property. In being compelled to labor,\n",
      "not for himself, but for a master; in being vendible by one master to\n",
      "another master; and in being subject at all times to be restrained\n",
      "in his liberty and chastised in his body, by the capricious will of\n",
      "another--the slave may appear to be degraded from the human rank,\n",
      "and classed with those irrational animals which fall under the legal\n",
      "denomination of property. In being protected, on the other hand, in\n",
      "his life and in his limbs, against the violence of all others, even the\n",
      "master of his labor and his liberty; and in being punishable himself for\n",
      "all violence committed against others--the slave is no less evidently\n",
      "regarded by the law as a member of the society, not as a part of\n",
      "the irrational creation; as a moral person, not as a mere article\n",
      "of property. The federal Constitution, therefore, decides with great\n",
      "propriety on the case of our slaves, when it views them in the mixed\n",
      "character of persons and of property. This is in fact their true\n",
      "character. It is the character bestowed on them by the laws under\n",
      "which they live; and it will not be denied, that these are the proper\n",
      "criterion; because it is only under the pretext that the laws have\n",
      "transformed the negroes into subjects of property, that a place is\n",
      "disputed them in the computation of numbers; and it is admitted, that\n",

      "negroes could no longer be refused an equal share of representation with\n",
      "the other inhabitants.\n",

      "been impartial or consistent, if they had rejected the slaves from\n",
      "the list of inhabitants, when the shares of representation were to\n",
      "be calculated, and inserted them on the lists when the tariff of\n",
      "contributions was to be adjusted? Could it be reasonably expected, that\n",
      "the Southern States would concur in a system, which considered their\n",
      "slaves in some degree as men, when burdens were to be imposed, but\n",
      "refused to consider them in the same light, when advantages were to be\n",
      "conferred? Might not some surprise also be expressed, that those who\n",
      "reproach the Southern States with the barbarous policy of considering as\n",
      "property a part of their human brethren, should themselves contend,\n",
      "that the government to which all the States are to be parties, ought to\n",
      "consider this unfortunate race more completely in the unnatural light of\n",
      "property, than the very laws of which they complain?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It may be replied, perhaps, that slaves are not included in the\n",
      "estimate of representatives in any of the States possessing them. They\n",
      "neither vote themselves nor increase the votes of their masters. Upon\n",
      "what principle, then, ought they to be taken into the federal estimate\n",
      "of representation? In rejecting them altogether, the Constitution would,\n",
      "in this respect, have followed the very laws which have been appealed to\n",
      "as the proper guide.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This objection is repelled by a single observation. It is a fundamental\n",
      "principle of the proposed Constitution, that as the aggregate number of\n",
      "representatives allotted to the several States is to be determined by\n",
      "a federal rule, founded on the aggregate number of inhabitants, so the\n",
      "right of choosing this allotted number in each State is to be exercised\n",
      "by such part of the inhabitants as the State itself may designate. The\n",
      "qualifications on which the right of suffrage depend are not, perhaps,\n",
      "the same in any two States. In some of the States the difference is\n",
      "very material. In every State, a certain proportion of inhabitants are\n",
      "deprived of this right by the constitution of the State, who will be\n",
      "included in the census by which the federal Constitution apportions the\n",
      "representatives. In this point of view the Southern States might\n",
      "retort the complaint, by insisting that the principle laid down by\n",
      "the convention required that no regard should be had to the policy of\n",
      "particular States towards their own inhabitants; and consequently, that\n",
      "the slaves, as inhabitants, should have been admitted into the census\n",
      "according to their full number, in like manner with other inhabitants,\n",
      "who, by the policy of other States, are not admitted to all the rights\n",
      "of citizens. A rigorous adherence, however, to this principle, is waived\n",
      "by those who would be gainers by it. All that they ask is that equal\n",
      "moderation be shown on the other side. Let the case of the slaves be\n",
      "considered, as it is in truth, a peculiar one. Let the compromising\n",
      "expedient of the Constitution be mutually adopted, which regards them as\n",
      "inhabitants, but as debased by servitude below the equal level of free\n",
      "inhabitants, which regards the SLAVE as divested of two fifths of the\n",
      "MAN.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"After all, may not another ground be taken on which this article of the\n",
      "Constitution will admit of a still more ready defense? We have hitherto\n",
      "proceeded on the idea that representation related to persons only, and\n",
      "not at all to property. But is it a just idea? Government is instituted\n",
      "no less for protection of the property, than of the persons, of\n",
      "individuals. The one as well as the other, therefore, may be considered\n",
      "as represented by those who are charged with the government. Upon this\n",
      "principle it is, that in several of the States, and particularly in\n",
      "the State of New York, one branch of the government is intended more\n",
      "especially to be the guardian of property, and is accordingly elected\n",
      "by that part of the society which is most interested in this object of\n",
      "government. In the federal Constitution, this policy does not prevail.\n",
      "The rights of property are committed into the same hands with the\n",
      "personal rights. Some attention ought, therefore, to be paid to property\n",
      "in the choice of those hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For another reason, the votes allowed in the federal legislature to the\n",
      "people of each State, ought to bear some proportion to the comparative\n",
      "wealth of the States. States have not, like individuals, an influence\n",
      "over each other, arising from superior advantages of fortune. If the\n",
      "law allows an opulent citizen but a single vote in the choice of his\n",
      "representative, the respect and consequence which he derives from his\n",
      "fortunate situation very frequently guide the votes of others to the\n",
      "objects of his choice; and through this imperceptible channel the\n",
      "rights of property are conveyed into the public representation. A State\n",
      "possesses no such influence over other States. It is not probable that\n",
      "the richest State in the Confederacy will ever influence the choice of\n",
      "a single representative in any other State. Nor will the representatives\n",
      "of the larger and richer States possess any other advantage in the\n",
      "federal legislature, over the representatives of other States, than what\n",
      "may result from their superior number alone. As far, therefore, as their\n",
      "superior wealth and weight may justly entitle them to any advantage, it\n",
      "ought to be secured to them by a superior share of representation. The\n",
      "new Constitution is, in this respect, materially different from the\n",
      "existing Confederation, as well as from that of the United Netherlands,\n",
      "and other similar confederacies. In each of the latter, the efficacy\n",
      "of the federal resolutions depends on the subsequent and voluntary\n",
      "resolutions of the states composing the union. Hence the states,\n",
      "though possessing an equal vote in the public councils, have an unequal\n",
      "influence, corresponding with the unequal importance of these subsequent\n",
      "and voluntary resolutions. Under the proposed Constitution, the\n",
      "federal acts will take effect without the necessary intervention of the\n",
      "individual States. They will depend merely on the majority of votes in\n",
      "the federal legislature, and consequently each vote, whether proceeding\n",
      "from a larger or smaller State, or a State more or less wealthy or\n",
      "powerful, will have an equal weight and efficacy: in the same manner\n",
      "as the votes individually given in a State legislature, by the\n",
      "representatives of unequal counties or other districts, have each a\n",
      "precise equality of value and effect; or if there be any difference in\n",
      "the case, it proceeds from the difference in the personal character of\n",
      "the individual representative, rather than from any regard to the extent\n",
      "of the district from which he comes.\"\n",

      "by the weight of character and the apparent force of argument with which\n",
      "it has been assailed. The charges exhibited against it are, first, that\n",
      "so small a number of representatives will be an unsafe depositary of\n",
      "the public interests; secondly, that they will not possess a proper\n",
      "knowledge of the local circumstances of their numerous constituents;\n",
      "thirdly, that they will be taken from that class of citizens which will\n",
      "sympathize least with the feelings of the mass of the people, and be\n",
      "most likely to aim at a permanent elevation of the few on the depression\n",
      "of the many; fourthly, that defective as the number will be in the first\n",
      "instance, it will be more and more disproportionate, by the increase\n",
      "of the people, and the obstacles which will prevent a correspondent\n",
      "increase of the representatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "In general it may be remarked on this subject, that no political problem\n",
      "is less susceptible of a precise solution than that which relates to the\n",
      "number most convenient for a representative legislature; nor is there\n",
      "any point on which the policy of the several States is more at variance,\n",
      "whether we compare their legislative assemblies directly with each\n",
      "other, or consider the proportions which they respectively bear to the\n",
      "number of their constituents. Passing over the difference between the\n",
      "smallest and largest States, as Delaware, whose most numerous branch\n",
      "consists of twenty-one representatives, and Massachusetts, where\n",
      "it amounts to between three and four hundred, a very considerable\n",
      "difference is observable among States nearly equal in population. The\n",
      "number of representatives in Pennsylvania is not more than one fifth of\n",
      "that in the State last mentioned. New York, whose population is to that\n",
      "of South Carolina as six to five, has little more than one third of the\n",
      "number of representatives. As great a disparity prevails between the\n",
      "States of Georgia and Delaware or Rhode Island. In Pennsylvania, the\n",
      "representatives do not bear a greater proportion to their constituents\n",
      "than of one for every four or five thousand. In Rhode Island, they bear\n",
      "a proportion of at least one for every thousand. And according to the\n",
      "constitution of Georgia, the proportion may be carried to one to every\n",
      "ten electors; and must unavoidably far exceed the proportion in any of\n",
      "the other States.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another general remark to be made is, that the ratio between the\n",
      "representatives and the people ought not to be the same where the latter\n",
      "are very numerous as where they are very few. Were the representatives\n",
      "in Virginia to be regulated by the standard in Rhode Island, they would,\n",
      "at this time, amount to between four and five hundred; and twenty or\n",
      "thirty years hence, to a thousand. On the other hand, the ratio of\n",
      "Pennsylvania, if applied to the State of Delaware, would reduce the\n",
      "representative assembly of the latter to seven or eight members. Nothing\n",
      "can be more fallacious than to found our political calculations on\n",
      "arithmetical principles. Sixty or seventy men may be more properly\n",
      "trusted with a given degree of power than six or seven. But it does\n",
      "not follow that six or seven hundred would be proportionably a better\n",
      "depositary. And if we carry on the supposition to six or seven thousand,\n",
      "the whole reasoning ought to be reversed. The truth is, that in all\n",
      "cases a certain number at least seems to be necessary to secure the\n",
      "benefits of free consultation and discussion, and to guard against too\n",
      "easy a combination for improper purposes; as, on the other hand, the\n",
      "number ought at most to be kept within a certain limit, in order\n",
      "to avoid the confusion and intemperance of a multitude. In all very\n",
      "numerous assemblies, of whatever character composed, passion never fails\n",
      "to wrest the sceptre from reason. Had every Athenian citizen been a\n",
      "Socrates, every Athenian assembly would still have been a mob.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is necessary also to recollect here the observations which were\n",
      "applied to the case of biennial elections. For the same reason that\n",
      "the limited powers of the Congress, and the control of the State\n",
      "legislatures, justify less frequent elections than the public safely\n",
      "might otherwise require, the members of the Congress need be less\n",
      "numerous than if they possessed the whole power of legislation, and were\n",
      "under no other than the ordinary restraints of other legislative bodies.\n",
      "\n",
      "With these general ideas in our mind, let us weigh the objections which\n",
      "have been stated against the number of members proposed for the House of\n",
      "Representatives. It is said, in the first place, that so small a number\n",
      "cannot be safely trusted with so much power.\n",
      "\n",
      "The number of which this branch of the legislature is to consist, at the\n",
      "outset of the government, will be sixty-five. Within three years a census\n",
      "is to be taken, when the number may be augmented to one for every thirty\n",
      "thousand inhabitants; and within every successive period of ten years\n",
      "the census is to be renewed, and augmentations may continue to be\n",
      "made under the above limitation. It will not be thought an extravagant\n",
      "conjecture that the first census will, at the rate of one for every\n",
      "thirty thousand, raise the number of representatives to at least one\n",
      "hundred. Estimating the negroes in the proportion of three fifths, it\n",
      "can scarcely be doubted that the population of the United States will\n",
      "by that time, if it does not already, amount to three millions. At\n",
      "the expiration of twenty-five years, according to the computed rate of\n",
      "increase, the number of representatives will amount to two hundred, and\n",
      "of fifty years, to four hundred. This is a number which, I presume, will\n",
      "put an end to all fears arising from the smallness of the body. I\n",
      "take for granted here what I shall, in answering the fourth objection,\n",
      "hereafter show, that the number of representatives will be augmented\n",
      "from time to time in the manner provided by the Constitution. On a\n",
      "contrary supposition, I should admit the objection to have very great\n",
      "weight indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The true question to be decided then is, whether the smallness of the\n",
      "number, as a temporary regulation, be dangerous to the public liberty?\n",
      "Whether sixty-five members for a few years, and a hundred or two hundred\n",
      "for a few more, be a safe depositary for a limited and well-guarded\n",
      "power of legislating for the United States? I must own that I could\n",
      "not give a negative answer to this question, without first obliterating\n",
      "every impression which I have received with regard to the present\n",
      "genius of the people of America, the spirit which actuates the State\n",

      "disposed to form and pursue a scheme of tyranny or treachery. I am\n",
      "unable to conceive that the State legislatures, which must feel so many\n",
      "motives to watch, and which possess so many means of counteracting,\n",
      "the federal legislature, would fail either to detect or to defeat\n",
      "a conspiracy of the latter against the liberties of their common\n",

      "of two years, to betray the solemn trust committed to them. What change\n",
      "of circumstances, time, and a fuller population of our country may\n",
      "produce, requires a prophetic spirit to declare, which makes no part of\n",
      "my pretensions. But judging from the circumstances now before us, and\n",

      "of hands proposed by the federal Constitution.\n",
      "\n",
      "From what quarter can the danger proceed? Are we afraid of foreign gold?\n",
      "If foreign gold could so easily corrupt our federal rulers and enable\n",
      "them to ensnare and betray their constituents, how has it happened that\n",
      "we are at this time a free and independent nation? The Congress which\n",
      "conducted us through the Revolution was a less numerous body than their\n",
      "successors will be; they were not chosen by, nor responsible to,\n",
      "their fellowcitizens at large; though appointed from year to year, and\n",
      "recallable at pleasure, they were generally continued for three years,\n",
      "and prior to the ratification of the federal articles, for a still\n",
      "longer term. They held their consultations always under the veil of\n",
      "secrecy; they had the sole transaction of our affairs with foreign\n",

      "not, and without a previous corruption of the House of Representatives\n",
      "cannot, more than suffice for very different purposes; their private\n",
      "fortunes, as they must all be American citizens, cannot possibly be\n",
      "sources of danger. The only means, then, which they can possess, will be\n",

      "the fidelity of the other House is to be the victim. The improbability\n",
      "of such a mercenary and perfidious combination of the several members\n",
      "of government, standing on as different foundations as republican\n",
      "principles will well admit, and at the same time accountable to\n",
      "the society over which they are placed, ought alone to quiet this\n",
      "apprehension. But, fortunately, the Constitution has provided a still\n",
      "further safeguard. The members of the Congress are rendered ineligible\n",
      "to any civil offices that may be created, or of which the emoluments may\n",
      "be increased, during the term of their election. No offices therefore\n",

      "is to renounce every rule by which events ought to be calculated, and\n",
      "to substitute an indiscriminate and unbounded jealousy, with which\n",
      "all reasoning must be vain. The sincere friends of liberty, who give\n",

      "THE THIRD charge against the House of Representatives is, that it will\n",
      "be taken from that class of citizens which will have least sympathy\n",
      "with the mass of the people, and be most likely to aim at an ambitious\n",
      "sacrifice of the many to the aggrandizement of the few.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of all the objections which have been framed against the federal\n",
      "Constitution, this is perhaps the most extraordinary. Whilst the\n",
      "objection itself is levelled against a pretended oligarchy, the\n",
      "principle of it strikes at the very root of republican government.\n",
      "\n",
      "The aim of every political constitution is, or ought to be, first to\n",
      "obtain for rulers men who possess most wisdom to discern, and most\n",
      "virtue to pursue, the common good of the society; and in the next place,\n",
      "to take the most effectual precautions for keeping them virtuous whilst\n",
      "they continue to hold their public trust. The elective mode of obtaining\n",
      "rulers is the characteristic policy of republican government. The means\n",
      "relied on in this form of government for preventing their degeneracy are\n",
      "numerous and various. The most effectual one, is such a limitation of\n",
      "the term of appointments as will maintain a proper responsibility to the\n",
      "people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me now ask what circumstance there is in the constitution of the\n",
      "House of Representatives that violates the principles of republican\n",
      "government, or favors the elevation of the few on the ruins of the many?\n",
      "Let me ask whether every circumstance is not, on the contrary, strictly\n",
      "conformable to these principles, and scrupulously impartial to the\n",
      "rights and pretensions of every class and description of citizens?\n",

      "more than the poor; not the learned, more than the ignorant; not the\n",
      "haughty heirs of distinguished names, more than the humble sons of\n",
      "obscurity and unpropitious fortune. The electors are to be the great\n",
      "body of the people of the United States. They are to be the same who\n",
      "exercise the right in every State of electing the corresponding branch\n",
      "of the legislature of the State.\n",
      "\n",
      "Who are to be the objects of popular choice? Every citizen whose merit\n",
      "may recommend him to the esteem and confidence of his country. No\n",
      "qualification of wealth, of birth, of religious faith, or of civil\n",
      "profession is permitted to fetter the judgement or disappoint the\n",

      "If we consider the situation of the men on whom the free suffrages of\n",
      "their fellow-citizens may confer the representative trust, we shall find\n",
      "it involving every security which can be devised or desired for their\n",
      "fidelity to their constituents.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first place, as they will have been distinguished by the\n",
      "preference of their fellow-citizens, we are to presume that in general\n",
      "they will be somewhat distinguished also by those qualities which\n",
      "entitle them to it, and which promise a sincere and scrupulous regard to\n",
      "the nature of their engagements.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the second place, they will enter into the public service under\n",
      "circumstances which cannot fail to produce a temporary affection at\n",
      "least to their constituents. There is in every breast a sensibility to\n",
      "marks of honor, of favor, of esteem, and of confidence, which, apart\n",
      "from all considerations of interest, is some pledge for grateful and\n",
      "benevolent returns. Ingratitude is a common topic of declamation against\n",
      "human nature; and it must be confessed that instances of it are but\n",
      "too frequent and flagrant, both in public and in private life. But the\n",
      "universal and extreme indignation which it inspires is itself a proof of\n",
      "the energy and prevalence of the contrary sentiment.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the third place, those ties which bind the representative to his\n",
      "constituents are strengthened by motives of a more selfish nature. His\n",
      "pride and vanity attach him to a form of government which favors his\n",
      "pretensions and gives him a share in its honors and distinctions.\n",
      "Whatever hopes or projects might be entertained by a few aspiring\n",
      "characters, it must generally happen that a great proportion of the men\n",
      "deriving their advancement from their influence with the people,\n",
      "would have more to hope from a preservation of the favor, than from\n",
      "innovations in the government subversive of the authority of the people.\n",
      "\n",
      "All these securities, however, would be found very insufficient without\n",
      "the restraint of frequent elections. Hence, in the fourth place, the\n",
      "House of Representatives is so constituted as to support in the members\n",
      "an habitual recollection of their dependence on the people. Before the\n",
      "sentiments impressed on their minds by the mode of their elevation\n",
      "can be effaced by the exercise of power, they will be compelled to\n",
      "anticipate the moment when their power is to cease, when their exercise\n",
      "of it is to be reviewed, and when they must descend to the level from\n",
      "which they were raised; there forever to remain unless a faithful\n",
      "discharge of their trust shall have established their title to a renewal\n",
      "of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will add, as a fifth circumstance in the situation of the House of\n",
      "Representatives, restraining them from oppressive measures, that they\n",
      "can make no law which will not have its full operation on themselves\n",
      "and their friends, as well as on the great mass of the society. This has\n",
      "always been deemed one of the strongest bonds by which human policy can\n",
      "connect the rulers and the people together. It creates between them\n",
      "that communion of interests and sympathy of sentiments, of which few\n",
      "governments have furnished examples; but without which every government\n",
      "degenerates into tyranny. If it be asked, what is to restrain the\n",
      "House of Representatives from making legal discriminations in favor of\n",
      "themselves and a particular class of the society? I answer: the genius\n",
      "of the whole system; the nature of just and constitutional laws; and\n",
      "above all, the vigilant and manly spirit which actuates the people of\n",
      "America--a spirit which nourishes freedom, and in return is nourished by\n",
      "it.\n",
      "\n",
      "If this spirit shall ever be so far debased as to tolerate a law not\n",
      "obligatory on the legislature, as well as on the people, the people will\n",
      "be prepared to tolerate any thing but liberty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such will be the relation between the House of Representatives and their\n",
      "constituents. Duty, gratitude, interest, ambition itself, are the chords\n",
      "by which they will be bound to fidelity and sympathy with the great\n",
      "mass of the people. It is possible that these may all be insufficient\n",
      "to control the caprice and wickedness of man. But are they not all that\n",
      "government will admit, and that human prudence can devise? Are they not\n",
      "the genuine and the characteristic means by which republican government\n",
      "provides for the liberty and happiness of the people? Are they not the\n",
      "identical means on which every State government in the Union relies for\n",
      "the attainment of these important ends? What then are we to understand\n",
      "by the objection which this paper has combated? What are we to say to\n",
      "the men who profess the most flaming zeal for republican government,\n",
      "yet boldly impeach the fundamental principle of it; who pretend to be\n",
      "champions for the right and the capacity of the people to choose their\n",
      "own rulers, yet maintain that they will prefer those only who will\n",
      "immediately and infallibly betray the trust committed to them?\n",
      "\n",
      "Were the objection to be read by one who had not seen the mode\n",
      "prescribed by the Constitution for the choice of representatives, he\n",
      "could suppose nothing less than that some unreasonable qualification\n",
      "of property was annexed to the right of suffrage; or that the right of\n",
      "eligibility was limited to persons of particular families or fortunes;\n",
      "or at least that the mode prescribed by the State constitutions was in\n",
      "some respect or other, very grossly departed from. We have seen how far\n",
      "such a supposition would err, as to the two first points. Nor would\n",
      "it, in fact, be less erroneous as to the last. The only difference\n",
      "discoverable between the two cases is, that each representative of the\n",
      "United States will be elected by five or six thousand citizens; whilst\n",
      "in the individual States, the election of a representative is left to\n",
      "about as many hundreds. Will it be pretended that this difference is\n",
      "sufficient to justify an attachment to the State governments, and an\n",
      "abhorrence to the federal government? If this be the point on which the\n",
      "objection turns, it deserves to be examined.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is it supported by REASON? This cannot be said, without maintaining\n",
      "that five or six thousand citizens are less capable of choosing a fit\n",
      "representative, or more liable to be corrupted by an unfit one, than\n",
      "five or six hundred. Reason, on the contrary, assures us, that as in so\n",
      "great a number a fit representative would be most likely to be found, so\n",
      "the choice would be less likely to be diverted from him by the intrigues\n",
      "of the ambitious or the ambitious or the bribes of the rich.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is the CONSEQUENCE from this doctrine admissible? If we say that five or\n",
      "six hundred citizens are as many as can jointly exercise their right\n",
      "of suffrage, must we not deprive the people of the immediate choice of\n",
      "their public servants, in every instance where the administration of the\n",
      "government does not require as many of them as will amount to one for\n",
      "that number of citizens?\n",
      "\n",
      "Is the doctrine warranted by FACTS? It was shown in the last paper,\n",
      "that the real representation in the British House of Commons very little\n",
      "exceeds the proportion of one for every thirty thousand inhabitants.\n",
      "Besides a variety of powerful causes not existing here, and which\n",
      "favor in that country the pretensions of rank and wealth, no person is\n",
      "eligible as a representative of a county, unless he possess real estate\n",
      "of the clear value of six hundred pounds sterling per year; nor of a\n",
      "city or borough, unless he possess a like estate of half that annual\n",
      "value. To this qualification on the part of the county representatives\n",
      "is added another on the part of the county electors, which restrains\n",
      "the right of suffrage to persons having a freehold estate of the annual\n",
      "value of more than twenty pounds sterling, according to the present\n",
      "rate of money. Notwithstanding these unfavorable circumstances, and\n",
      "notwithstanding some very unequal laws in the British code, it cannot be\n",
      "said that the representatives of the nation have elevated the few on the\n",
      "ruins of the many.\n",
      "\n",
      "But we need not resort to foreign experience on this subject. Our own\n",
      "is explicit and decisive. The districts in New Hampshire in which the\n",
      "senators are chosen immediately by the people, are nearly as large as\n",
      "will be necessary for her representatives in the Congress. Those of\n",
      "Massachusetts are larger than will be necessary for that purpose;\n",
      "and those of New York still more so. In the last State the members of\n",
      "Assembly for the cities and counties of New York and Albany are elected\n",
      "by very nearly as many voters as will be entitled to a representative\n",
      "in the Congress, calculating on the number of sixty-five representatives\n",
      "only. It makes no difference that in these senatorial districts and\n",
      "counties a number of representatives are voted for by each elector at\n",
      "the same time. If the same electors at the same time are capable of\n",
      "choosing four or five representatives, they cannot be incapable of\n",
      "choosing one. Pennsylvania is an additional example. Some of her\n",
      "counties, which elect her State representatives, are almost as large\n",
      "as her districts will be by which her federal representatives will be\n",
      "elected. The city of Philadelphia is supposed to contain between fifty\n",
      "and sixty thousand souls. It will therefore form nearly two districts\n",
      "for the choice of federal representatives. It forms, however, but one\n",
      "county, in which every elector votes for each of its representatives in\n",
      "the State legislature. And what may appear to be still more directly\n",
      "to our purpose, the whole city actually elects a SINGLE MEMBER for the\n",
      "executive council. This is the case in all the other counties of the\n",
      "State.\n",
      "\n",
      "Are not these facts the most satisfactory proofs of the fallacy which\n",
      "has been employed against the branch of the federal government under\n",
      "consideration? Has it appeared on trial that the senators of New\n",
      "Hampshire, Massachusetts, and New York, or the executive council of\n",
      "Pennsylvania, or the members of the Assembly in the two last States,\n",
      "have betrayed any peculiar disposition to sacrifice the many to the\n",
      "few, or are in any respect less worthy of their places than the\n",
      "representatives and magistrates appointed in other States by very small\n",
      "divisions of the people?\n",
      "\n",
      "But there are cases of a stronger complexion than any which I have yet\n",
      "quoted. One branch of the legislature of Connecticut is so constituted\n",
      "that each member of it is elected by the whole State. So is the governor\n",
      "of that State, of Massachusetts, and of this State, and the president of\n",
      "New Hampshire. I leave every man to decide whether the result of any\n",
      "one of these experiments can be said to countenance a suspicion, that\n",
      "a diffusive mode of choosing representatives of the people tends to\n",
      "elevate traitors and to undermine the public liberty.\n",

      "THE remaining charge against the House of Representatives, which I am\n",
      "to examine, is grounded on a supposition that the number of members will\n",
      "not be augmented from time to time, as the progress of population may\n",
      "demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has been admitted, that this objection, if well supported, would have\n",
      "great weight. The following observations will show that, like most other\n",
      "objections against the Constitution, it can only proceed from a partial\n",
      "view of the subject, or from a jealousy which discolors and disfigures\n",
      "every object which is beheld.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Those who urge the objection seem not to have recollected that the\n",
      "federal Constitution will not suffer by a comparison with the State\n",
      "constitutions, in the security provided for a gradual augmentation of\n",
      "the number of representatives. The number which is to prevail in the\n",
      "first instance is declared to be temporary. Its duration is limited to\n",
      "the short term of three years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Within every successive term of ten years a census of inhabitants is to\n",
      "be repeated. The unequivocal objects of these regulations are, first, to\n",
      "readjust, from time to time, the apportionment of representatives to the\n",
      "number of inhabitants, under the single exception that each State shall\n",
      "have one representative at least; secondly, to augment the number of\n",
      "representatives at the same periods, under the sole limitation that the\n",
      "whole number shall not exceed one for every thirty thousand inhabitants.\n",
      "If we review the constitutions of the several States, we shall find that\n",
      "some of them contain no determinate regulations on this subject,\n",
      "that others correspond pretty much on this point with the federal\n",
      "Constitution, and that the most effectual security in any of them is\n",
      "resolvable into a mere directory provision.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. As far as experience has taken place on this subject, a gradual\n",
      "increase of representatives under the State constitutions has at least\n",
      "kept pace with that of the constituents, and it appears that the former\n",
      "have been as ready to concur in such measures as the latter have been to\n",
      "call for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. There is a peculiarity in the federal Constitution which insures\n",
      "a watchful attention in a majority both of the people and of their\n",
      "representatives to a constitutional augmentation of the latter. The\n",
      "peculiarity lies in this, that one branch of the legislature is a\n",
      "representation of citizens, the other of the States: in the former,\n",
      "consequently, the larger States will have most weight; in the latter,\n",
      "the advantage will be in favor of the smaller States. From this\n",
      "circumstance it may with certainty be inferred that the larger States\n",
      "will be strenuous advocates for increasing the number and weight of that\n",
      "part of the legislature in which their influence predominates. And it so\n",
      "happens that four only of the largest will have a majority of the whole\n",
      "votes in the House of Representatives. Should the representatives or\n",
      "people, therefore, of the smaller States oppose at any time a reasonable\n",
      "addition of members, a coalition of a very few States will be sufficient\n",
      "to overrule the opposition; a coalition which, notwithstanding the\n",
      "rivalship and local prejudices which might prevent it on ordinary\n",
      "occasions, would not fail to take place, when not merely prompted by\n",
      "common interest, but justified by equity and the principles of the\n",
      "Constitution.\n",
      "\n",
      "It may be alleged, perhaps, that the Senate would be prompted by like\n",
      "motives to an adverse coalition; and as their concurrence would be\n",
      "indispensable, the just and constitutional views of the other branch\n",
      "might be defeated. This is the difficulty which has probably created\n",
      "the most serious apprehensions in the jealous friends of a numerous\n",
      "representation. Fortunately it is among the difficulties which, existing\n",
      "only in appearance, vanish on a close and accurate inspection. The\n",
      "following reflections will, if I mistake not, be admitted to be\n",
      "conclusive and satisfactory on this point.\n",
      "\n",
      "Notwithstanding the equal authority which will subsist between the two\n",
      "houses on all legislative subjects, except the originating of money\n",
      "bills, it cannot be doubted that the House, composed of the greater\n",
      "number of members, when supported by the more powerful States, and\n",
      "speaking the known and determined sense of a majority of the people,\n",
      "will have no small advantage in a question depending on the comparative\n",
      "firmness of the two houses.\n",
      "\n",
      "This advantage must be increased by the consciousness, felt by the same\n",
      "side of being supported in its demands by right, by reason, and by the\n",
      "Constitution; and the consciousness, on the opposite side, of contending\n",
      "against the force of all these solemn considerations.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is farther to be considered, that in the gradation between the\n",
      "smallest and largest States, there are several, which, though most\n",
      "likely in general to arrange themselves among the former are too\n",
      "little removed in extent and population from the latter, to second an\n",
      "opposition to their just and legitimate pretensions. Hence it is by no\n",
      "means certain that a majority of votes, even in the Senate, would be\n",
      "unfriendly to proper augmentations in the number of representatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "It will not be looking too far to add, that the senators from all\n",
      "the new States may be gained over to the just views of the House of\n",
      "Representatives, by an expedient too obvious to be overlooked. As these\n",
      "States will, for a great length of time, advance in population with\n",
      "peculiar rapidity, they will be interested in frequent reapportionments\n",
      "of the representatives to the number of inhabitants. The large States,\n",
      "therefore, who will prevail in the House of Representatives, will have\n",
      "nothing to do but to make reapportionments and augmentations mutually\n",
      "conditions of each other; and the senators from all the most growing\n",
      "States will be bound to contend for the latter, by the interest which\n",
      "their States will feel in the former.\n",
      "\n",
      "These considerations seem to afford ample security on this subject, and\n",
      "ought alone to satisfy all the doubts and fears which have been\n",
      "indulged with regard to it. Admitting, however, that they should all be\n",
      "insufficient to subdue the unjust policy of the smaller States, or their\n",
      "predominant influence in the councils of the Senate, a constitutional\n",
      "and infallible resource still remains with the larger States, by which\n",
      "they will be able at all times to accomplish their just purposes. The\n",
      "House of Representatives cannot only refuse, but they alone can propose,\n",
      "the supplies requisite for the support of government. They, in a word,\n",
      "hold the purse--that powerful instrument by which we behold, in the\n",
      "history of the British Constitution, an infant and humble representation\n",
      "of the people gradually enlarging the sphere of its activity and\n",
      "importance, and finally reducing, as far as it seems to have wished, all\n",
      "the overgrown prerogatives of the other branches of the government. This\n",
      "power over the purse may, in fact, be regarded as the most complete\n",
      "and effectual weapon with which any constitution can arm the immediate\n",
      "representatives of the people, for obtaining a redress of every\n",
      "grievance, and for carrying into effect every just and salutary measure.\n",
      "\n",
      "But will not the House of Representatives be as much interested as the\n",
      "Senate in maintaining the government in its proper functions, and will\n",
      "they not therefore be unwilling to stake its existence or its reputation\n",
      "on the pliancy of the Senate? Or, if such a trial of firmness between\n",
      "the two branches were hazarded, would not the one be as likely first to\n",
      "yield as the other? These questions will create no difficulty with\n",
      "those who reflect that in all cases the smaller the number, and the more\n",
      "permanent and conspicuous the station, of men in power, the stronger\n",
      "must be the interest which they will individually feel in whatever\n",
      "concerns the government. Those who represent the dignity of their\n",
      "country in the eyes of other nations, will be particularly sensible to\n",
      "every prospect of public danger, or of dishonorable stagnation in public\n",
      "affairs. To those causes we are to ascribe the continual triumph of\n",

      "if a sceptre had been placed in his single hand. On the same principle,\n",
      "the more multitudinous a representative assembly may be rendered, the\n",
      "more it will partake of the infirmities incident to collective meetings\n",
      "of the people. Ignorance will be the dupe of cunning, and passion the\n",
      "slave of sophistry and declamation. The people can never err more than\n",
      "in supposing that by multiplying their representatives beyond a certain\n",
      "limit, they strengthen the barrier against the government of a few.\n",

      "SECURING A SUFFICIENT NUMBER FOR THE PURPOSES OF SAFETY, OF LOCAL\n",
      "INFORMATION, AND OF DIFFUSIVE SYMPATHY WITH THE WHOLE SOCIETY, they will\n",
      "counteract their own views by every addition to their representatives.\n",
      "The countenance of the government may become more democratic, but the\n",
      "soul that animates it will be more oligarchic. The machine will be\n",
      "enlarged, but the fewer, and often the more secret, will be the springs\n",
      "by which its motions are directed.\n",

      "As connected with the objection against the number of representatives,\n",
      "may properly be here noticed, that which has been suggested against the\n",
      "number made competent for legislative business. It has been said that\n",
      "more than a majority ought to have been required for a quorum; and in\n",
      "particular cases, if not in all, more than a majority of a quorum for\n",

      "that provision of the Constitution which authorizes the national\n",
      "legislature to regulate, in the last resort, the election of its own\n",
      "members. It is in these words: \"The TIMES, PLACES, and MANNER of holding\n",

      "gentleman who has declared himself the advocate of every other part of\n",
      "the system.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am greatly mistaken, notwithstanding, if there be any article in the\n",
      "whole plan more completely defensible than this. Its propriety rests\n",
      "upon the evidence of this plain proposition, that EVERY GOVERNMENT\n",
      "OUGHT TO CONTAIN IN ITSELF THE MEANS OF ITS OWN PRESERVATION. Every just\n",
      "reasoner will, at first sight, approve an adherence to this rule, in\n",
      "the work of the convention; and will disapprove every deviation from\n",
      "it which may not appear to have been dictated by the necessity of\n",
      "incorporating into the work some particular ingredient, with which a\n",
      "rigid conformity to the rule was incompatible. Even in this case, though\n",

      "It will not be alleged, that an election law could have been framed and\n",
      "inserted in the Constitution, which would have been always applicable\n",
      "to every probable change in the situation of the country; and it will\n",
      "therefore not be denied, that a discretionary power over elections ought\n",
      "to exist somewhere. It will, I presume, be as readily conceded,\n",
      "that there were only three ways in which this power could have been\n",
      "reasonably modified and disposed: that it must either have been lodged\n",
      "wholly in the national legislature, or wholly in the State legislatures,\n",
      "or primarily in the latter and ultimately in the former. The last mode\n",
      "has, with reason, been preferred by the convention. They have submitted\n",
      "the regulation of elections for the federal government, in the first\n",
      "instance, to the local administrations; which, in ordinary cases, and\n",
      "when no improper views prevail, may be both more convenient and more\n",

      "Nothing can be more evident, than that an exclusive power of regulating\n",

      "mercy. They could at any moment annihilate it, by neglecting to provide\n",
      "for the choice of persons to administer its affairs. It is to little\n",
      "purpose to say, that a neglect or omission of this kind would not be\n",
      "likely to take place. The constitutional possibility of the thing,\n",
      "without an equivalent for the risk, is an unanswerable objection. Nor\n",

      "inferred, that as its existence would be thus rendered dependent upon\n",
      "them in so essential a point, there can be no objection to intrusting\n",
      "them with it in the particular case under consideration. The interest\n",

      "it will not follow that, because they have a power to do this in one\n",
      "instance, they ought to have it in every other. There are cases in\n",

      "without any motive equally cogent with that which must have regulated\n",
      "the conduct of the convention in respect to the formation of the\n",
      "Senate, to recommend their admission into the system. So far as that\n",
      "construction may expose the Union to the possibility of injury from the\n",

      "have been avoided without excluding the States, in their political\n",
      "capacities, wholly from a place in the organization of the national\n",
      "government. If this had been done, it would doubtless have been\n",
      "interpreted into an entire dereliction of the federal principle; and\n",
      "would certainly have deprived the State governments of that absolute\n",
      "safeguard which they will enjoy under this provision. But however wise\n",
      "it may have been to have submitted in this instance to an inconvenience,\n",
      "for the attainment of a necessary advantage or a greater good, no\n",
      "inference can be drawn from thence to favor an accumulation of the evil,\n",
      "where no necessity urges, nor any greater good invites.\n",
      "\n",
      "It may be easily discerned also that the national government would run\n",
      "a much greater risk from a power in the State legislatures over the\n",
      "elections of its House of Representatives, than from their power of\n",
      "appointing the members of its Senate. The senators are to be chosen for\n",
      "the period of six years; there is to be a rotation, by which the seats\n",
      "of a third part of them are to be vacated and replenished every two\n",
      "years; and no State is to be entitled to more than two senators; a\n",
      "quorum of the body is to consist of sixteen members. The joint result\n",
      "of these circumstances would be, that a temporary combination of a few\n",
      "States to intermit the appointment of senators, could neither annul\n",
      "the existence nor impair the activity of the body; and it is not from\n",
      "a general and permanent combination of the States that we can have any\n",
      "thing to fear. The first might proceed from sinister designs in the\n",
      "leading members of a few of the State legislatures; the last would\n",
      "suppose a fixed and rooted disaffection in the great body of the people,\n",
      "which will either never exist at all, or will, in all probability,\n",

      "to the advancement of their happiness in which event no good citizen\n",
      "could desire its continuance.\n",
      "\n",
      "But with regard to the federal House of Representatives, there is\n",
      "intended to be a general election of members once in two years. If\n",
      "the State legislatures were to be invested with an exclusive power\n",
      "of regulating these elections, every period of making them would be\n",

      "councils, will be a security against the abuse of a power over its\n",

      "and the individuals who have the greatest credit in their councils, is\n",
      "exemplified in some of the States at the present moment, on the present\n",

      "councils, than that the one or the other of them should predominate in\n",
      "all the local councils. The inference will be, that a conduct tending to\n",

      "The several States are in various degrees addicted to agriculture and\n",

      "In a country consisting chiefly of the cultivators of land, where the\n",

      "to inflict upon it so deep a wound as would result from the entire\n",
      "exclusion of those who would best understand its interest from a share\n",
      "in the management of them. The importance of commerce, in the view of\n",

      "positive advantage which will result from this disposition, and which\n",

      "least as many different periods as there are months in the year. The\n",
      "times of election in the several States, as they are now established for\n",

      "resist. I am inclined to think that treble the duration in office, with\n",
      "the condition of a total dissolution of the body at the same time, might\n",

      "HAVING examined the constitution of the House of Representatives, and\n",
      "answered such of the objections against it as seemed to merit notice, I\n",
      "enter next on the examination of the Senate. The heads into which this\n",
      "member of the government may be considered are: I. The qualification of\n",
      "senators; II. The appointment of them by the State legislatures;\n",
      "III. The equality of representation in the Senate; IV. The number of\n",

      "\n",
      "I. The qualifications proposed for senators, as distinguished from those\n",
      "of representatives, consist in a more advanced age and a longer period\n",
      "of citizenship. A senator must be thirty years of age at least; as a\n",
      "representative must be twenty-five. And the former must have been a\n",
      "citizen nine years; as seven years are required for the latter. The\n",
      "propriety of these distinctions is explained by the nature of the\n",
      "senatorial trust, which, requiring greater extent of information and\n",
      "stability of character, requires at the same time that the senator should\n",
      "have reached a period of life most likely to supply these advantages;\n",
      "and which, participating immediately in transactions with foreign\n",
      "nations, ought to be exercised by none who are not thoroughly weaned\n",
      "from the prepossessions and habits incident to foreign birth and\n",
      "education. The term of nine years appears to be a prudent mediocrity\n",
      "between a total exclusion of adopted citizens, whose merits and talents\n",
      "may claim a share in the public confidence, and an indiscriminate\n",
      "and hasty admission of them, which might create a channel for foreign\n",
      "influence on the national councils.\n",
      "\n",
      "II. It is equally unnecessary to dilate on the appointment of senators\n",
      "by the State legislatures. Among the various modes which might have been\n",
      "devised for constituting this branch of the government, that which has\n",
      "been proposed by the convention is probably the most congenial with the\n",
      "public opinion. It is recommended by the double advantage of favoring\n",
      "a select appointment, and of giving to the State governments such an\n",
      "agency in the formation of the federal government as must secure the\n",
      "authority of the former, and may form a convenient link between the two\n",
      "systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "III. The equality of representation in the Senate is another point,\n",
      "which, being evidently the result of compromise between the opposite\n",
      "pretensions of the large and the small States, does not call for much\n",
      "discussion. If indeed it be right, that among a people thoroughly\n",
      "incorporated into one nation, every district ought to have a\n",
      "PROPORTIONAL share in the government, and that among independent and\n",
      "sovereign States, bound together by a simple league, the parties,\n",
      "however unequal in size, ought to have an EQUAL share in the common\n",
      "councils, it does not appear to be without some reason that in a\n",
      "compound republic, partaking both of the national and federal character,\n",
      "the government ought to be founded on a mixture of the principles of\n",
      "proportional and equal representation. But it is superfluous to try, by\n",
      "the standard of theory, a part of the Constitution which is allowed on\n",
      "all hands to be the result, not of theory, but \"of a spirit of amity,\n",
      "and that mutual deference and concession which the peculiarity of our\n",
      "political situation rendered indispensable.\" A common government, with\n",
      "powers equal to its objects, is called for by the voice, and still more\n",
      "loudly by the political situation, of America. A government founded on\n",
      "principles more consonant to the wishes of the larger States, is not\n",
      "likely to be obtained from the smaller States. The only option, then,\n",
      "for the former, lies between the proposed government and a government\n",
      "still more objectionable. Under this alternative, the advice of\n",
      "prudence must be to embrace the lesser evil; and, instead of indulging\n",
      "a fruitless anticipation of the possible mischiefs which may ensue, to\n",
      "contemplate rather the advantageous consequences which may qualify the\n",
      "sacrifice.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this spirit it may be remarked, that the equal vote allowed to\n",
      "each State is at once a constitutional recognition of the portion of\n",
      "sovereignty remaining in the individual States, and an instrument for\n",
      "preserving that residuary sovereignty. So far the equality ought to be\n",
      "no less acceptable to the large than to the small States; since they are\n",

      "improper consolidation of the States into one simple republic.\n",

      "concurrence, first, of a majority of the people, and then, of a majority\n",
      "of the States. It must be acknowledged that this complicated check on\n",
      "legislation may in some instances be injurious as well as beneficial;\n",
      "and that the peculiar defense which it involves in favor of the smaller\n",
      "States, would be more rational, if any interests common to them, and\n",
      "distinct from those of the other States, would otherwise be exposed to\n",
      "peculiar danger. But as the larger States will always be able, by\n",
      "their power over the supplies, to defeat unreasonable exertions of\n",
      "this prerogative of the lesser States, and as the faculty and excess\n",
      "of law-making seem to be the diseases to which our governments are most\n",
      "liable, it is not impossible that this part of the Constitution may be\n",
      "more convenient in practice than it appears to many in contemplation.\n",
      "\n",
      "IV. The number of senators, and the duration of their appointment, come\n",
      "next to be considered. In order to form an accurate judgment on both of\n",
      "these points, it will be proper to inquire into the purposes which are\n",
      "to be answered by a senate; and in order to ascertain these, it will be\n",
      "necessary to review the inconveniences which a republic must suffer from\n",
      "the want of such an institution.\n",
      "\n",
      "First. It is a misfortune incident to republican government, though in a\n",
      "less degree than to other governments, that those who administer it may\n",
      "forget their obligations to their constituents, and prove unfaithful\n",
      "to their important trust. In this point of view, a senate, as a second\n",
      "branch of the legislative assembly, distinct from, and dividing the\n",
      "power with, a first, must be in all cases a salutary check on the\n",
      "government. It doubles the security to the people, by requiring the\n",
      "concurrence of two distinct bodies in schemes of usurpation or perfidy,\n",
      "where the ambition or corruption of one would otherwise be sufficient.\n",
      "This is a precaution founded on such clear principles, and now so well\n",
      "understood in the United States, that it would be more than superfluous\n",
      "to enlarge on it. I will barely remark, that as the improbability of\n",
      "sinister combinations will be in proportion to the dissimilarity in the\n",
      "genius of the two bodies, it must be politic to distinguish them from\n",
      "each other by every circumstance which will consist with a due harmony\n",
      "in all proper measures, and with the genuine principles of republican\n",
      "government.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second. The necessity of a senate is not less indicated by the\n",
      "propensity of all single and numerous assemblies to yield to the impulse\n",
      "of sudden and violent passions, and to be seduced by factious leaders\n",
      "into intemperate and pernicious resolutions. Examples on this subject\n",
      "might be cited without number; and from proceedings within the United\n",
      "States, as well as from the history of other nations. But a position\n",
      "that will not be contradicted, need not be proved. All that need be\n",
      "remarked is, that a body which is to correct this infirmity ought itself\n",
      "to be free from it, and consequently ought to be less numerous. It\n",
      "ought, moreover, to possess great firmness, and consequently ought to\n",
      "hold its authority by a tenure of considerable duration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third. Another defect to be supplied by a senate lies in a want of due\n",
      "acquaintance with the objects and principles of legislation. It is not\n",
      "possible that an assembly of men called for the most part from pursuits\n",
      "of a private nature, continued in appointment for a short time, and led\n",
      "by no permanent motive to devote the intervals of public occupation to a\n",
      "study of the laws, the affairs, and the comprehensive interests of\n",
      "their country, should, if left wholly to themselves, escape a variety of\n",
      "important errors in the exercise of their legislative trust. It may\n",
      "be affirmed, on the best grounds, that no small share of the present\n",
      "embarrassments of America is to be charged on the blunders of our\n",
      "governments; and that these have proceeded from the heads rather than\n",
      "the hearts of most of the authors of them. What indeed are all the\n",
      "repealing, explaining, and amending laws, which fill and disgrace our\n",
      "voluminous codes, but so many monuments of deficient wisdom; so many\n",
      "impeachments exhibited by each succeeding against each preceding\n",
      "session; so many admonitions to the people, of the value of those aids\n",
      "which may be expected from a well-constituted senate?\n",
      "\n",
      "A good government implies two things: first, fidelity to the object of\n",
      "government, which is the happiness of the people; secondly, a knowledge\n",
      "of the means by which that object can be best attained. Some governments\n",
      "are deficient in both these qualities; most governments are deficient\n",
      "in the first. I scruple not to assert, that in American governments too\n",
      "little attention has been paid to the last. The federal Constitution\n",
      "avoids this error; and what merits particular notice, it provides for\n",
      "the last in a mode which increases the security for the first.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fourth. The mutability in the public councils arising from a rapid\n",
      "succession of new members, however qualified they may be, points out,\n",
      "in the strongest manner, the necessity of some stable institution in the\n",
      "government. Every new election in the States is found to change one half\n",
      "of the representatives. From this change of men must proceed a change\n",
      "of opinions; and from a change of opinions, a change of measures. But a\n",
      "continual change even of good measures is inconsistent with every rule\n",
      "of prudence and every prospect of success. The remark is verified in\n",
      "private life, and becomes more just, as well as more important, in\n",
      "national transactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "To trace the mischievous effects of a mutable government would fill a\n",
      "volume. I will hint a few only, each of which will be perceived to be a\n",
      "source of innumerable others.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first place, it forfeits the respect and confidence of other\n",
      "nations, and all the advantages connected with national character. An\n",
      "individual who is observed to be inconstant to his plans, or perhaps to\n",
      "carry on his affairs without any plan at all, is marked at once, by all\n",
      "prudent people, as a speedy victim to his own unsteadiness and folly.\n",
      "His more friendly neighbors may pity him, but all will decline\n",
      "to connect their fortunes with his; and not a few will seize the\n",
      "opportunity of making their fortunes out of his. One nation is to\n",
      "another what one individual is to another; with this melancholy\n",
      "distinction perhaps, that the former, with fewer of the benevolent\n",
      "emotions than the latter, are under fewer restraints also from taking\n",
      "undue advantage from the indiscretions of each other. Every nation,\n",
      "consequently, whose affairs betray a want of wisdom and stability, may\n",
      "calculate on every loss which can be sustained from the more systematic\n",
      "policy of their wiser neighbors. But the best instruction on this\n",
      "subject is unhappily conveyed to America by the example of her own\n",
      "situation. She finds that she is held in no respect by her friends;\n",
      "that she is the derision of her enemies; and that she is a prey to every\n",
      "nation which has an interest in speculating on her fluctuating councils\n",
      "and embarrassed affairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The internal effects of a mutable policy are still more calamitous. It\n",
      "poisons the blessing of liberty itself. It will be of little avail to\n",
      "the people, that the laws are made by men of their own choice, if the\n",
      "laws be so voluminous that they cannot be read, or so incoherent that\n",
      "they cannot be understood; if they be repealed or revised before they\n",
      "are promulgated, or undergo such incessant changes that no man, who\n",
      "knows what the law is to-day, can guess what it will be to-morrow. Law\n",
      "is defined to be a rule of action; but how can that be a rule, which is\n",
      "little known, and less fixed?\n",
      "\n",
      "Another effect of public instability is the unreasonable advantage it\n",
      "gives to the sagacious, the enterprising, and the moneyed few over\n",
      "the industrious and uninformed mass of the people. Every new regulation\n",
      "concerning commerce or revenue, or in any way affecting the value of the\n",
      "different species of property, presents a new harvest to those who watch\n",
      "the change, and can trace its consequences; a harvest, reared not\n",
      "by themselves, but by the toils and cares of the great body of their\n",
      "fellow-citizens. This is a state of things in which it may be said with\n",
      "some truth that laws are made for the FEW, not for the MANY.\n",
      "\n",
      "In another point of view, great injury results from an unstable\n",
      "government. The want of confidence in the public councils damps every\n",
      "useful undertaking, the success and profit of which may depend on a\n",
      "continuance of existing arrangements. What prudent merchant will hazard\n",
      "his fortunes in any new branch of commerce when he knows not but that\n",
      "his plans may be rendered unlawful before they can be executed? What\n",
      "farmer or manufacturer will lay himself out for the encouragement given\n",
      "to any particular cultivation or establishment, when he can have no\n",
      "assurance that his preparatory labors and advances will not render him\n",
      "a victim to an inconstant government? In a word, no great improvement\n",
      "or laudable enterprise can go forward which requires the auspices of a\n",
      "steady system of national policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the most deplorable effect of all is that diminution of attachment\n",
      "and reverence which steals into the hearts of the people, towards\n",
      "a political system which betrays so many marks of infirmity, and\n",
      "disappoints so many of their flattering hopes. No government, any\n",
      "more than an individual, will long be respected without being truly\n",
      "respectable; nor be truly respectable, without possessing a certain\n",

      "A FIFTH desideratum, illustrating the utility of a senate, is the want\n",
      "of a due sense of national character. Without a select and stable\n",
      "member of the government, the esteem of foreign powers will not only be\n",
      "forfeited by an unenlightened and variable policy, proceeding from the\n",
      "causes already mentioned, but the national councils will not possess\n",
      "that sensibility to the opinion of the world, which is perhaps not\n",
      "less necessary in order to merit, than it is to obtain, its respect and\n",
      "confidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "An attention to the judgment of other nations is important to every\n",
      "government for two reasons: the one is, that, independently of the\n",
      "merits of any particular plan or measure, it is desirable, on various\n",
      "accounts, that it should appear to other nations as the offspring of\n",
      "a wise and honorable policy; the second is, that in doubtful cases,\n",
      "particularly where the national councils may be warped by some strong\n",
      "passion or momentary interest, the presumed or known opinion of the\n",
      "impartial world may be the best guide that can be followed. What has not\n",
      "America lost by her want of character with foreign nations; and how\n",

      "public trust, that the pride and consequence of its members may\n",
      "be sensibly incorporated with the reputation and prosperity of the\n",
      "community. The half-yearly representatives of Rhode Island would\n",
      "probably have been little affected in their deliberations on the\n",
      "iniquitous measures of that State, by arguments drawn from the light in\n",
      "which such measures would be viewed by foreign nations, or even by the\n",
      "sister States; whilst it can scarcely be doubted that if the concurrence\n",
      "of a select and stable body had been necessary, a regard to national\n",
      "character alone would have prevented the calamities under which that\n",
      "misguided people is now laboring.\n",
      "\n",
      "I add, as a SIXTH defect the want, in some important cases, of a due\n",
      "responsibility in the government to the people, arising from\n",
      "that frequency of elections which in other cases produces this\n",
      "responsibility. This remark will, perhaps, appear not only new, but\n",
      "paradoxical. It must nevertheless be acknowledged, when explained, to be\n",
      "as undeniable as it is important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Responsibility, in order to be reasonable, must be limited to objects\n",
      "within the power of the responsible party, and in order to be effectual,\n",
      "must relate to operations of that power, of which a ready and proper\n",
      "judgment can be formed by the constituents. The objects of government\n",
      "may be divided into two general classes: the one depending on measures\n",
      "which have singly an immediate and sensible operation; the other\n",
      "depending on a succession of well-chosen and well-connected measures,\n",
      "which have a gradual and perhaps unobserved operation. The importance of\n",
      "the latter description to the collective and permanent welfare of every\n",
      "country, needs no explanation. And yet it is evident that an assembly\n",
      "elected for so short a term as to be unable to provide more than one\n",
      "or two links in a chain of measures, on which the general welfare may\n",
      "essentially depend, ought not to be answerable for the final result,\n",

      "to the infection of violent passions, or to the danger of combining\n",
      "in pursuit of unjust measures. I am far from denying that this is a\n",
      "distinction of peculiar importance. I have, on the contrary,\n",
      "endeavored in a former paper to show, that it is one of the principal\n",
      "recommendations of a confederated republic. At the same time, this\n",
      "advantage ought not to be considered as superseding the use of auxiliary\n",

      "misrepresentations which the combined industry of interested men may\n",
      "succeed in distributing among them.\n",
      "\n",
      "It adds no small weight to all these considerations, to recollect that\n",
      "history informs us of no long-lived republic which had not a senate.\n",
      "Sparta, Rome, and Carthage are, in fact, the only states to whom that\n",
      "character can be applied. In each of the two first there was a senate\n",
      "for life. The constitution of the senate in the last is less known.\n",
      "Circumstantial evidence makes it probable that it was not different in\n",
      "this particular from the two others. It is at least certain, that it\n",
      "had some quality or other which rendered it an anchor against popular\n",
      "fluctuations; and that a smaller council, drawn out of the senate,\n",
      "was appointed not only for life, but filled up vacancies itself. These\n",
      "examples, though as unfit for the imitation, as they are repugnant to\n",
      "the genius, of America, are, notwithstanding, when compared with the\n",
      "fugitive and turbulent existence of other ancient republics, very\n",
      "instructive proofs of the necessity of some institution that will blend\n",
      "stability with liberty. I am not unaware of the circumstances which\n",
      "distinguish the American from other popular governments, as well\n",
      "ancient as modern; and which render extreme circumspection necessary, in\n",
      "reasoning from the one case to the other. But after allowing due weight\n",
      "to this consideration, it may still be maintained, that there are many\n",
      "points of similitude which render these examples not unworthy of our\n",
      "attention. Many of the defects, as we have seen, which can only be\n",
      "supplied by a senatorial institution, are common to a numerous assembly\n",
      "frequently elected by the people, and to the people themselves. There\n",
      "are others peculiar to the former, which require the control of such an\n",
      "institution. The people can never wilfully betray their own interests;\n",
      "but they may possibly be betrayed by the representatives of the people;\n",
      "and the danger will be evidently greater where the whole legislative\n",
      "trust is lodged in the hands of one body of men, than where the\n",
      "concurrence of separate and dissimilar bodies is required in every\n",
      "public act.\n",
      "\n",
      "The difference most relied on, between the American and other republics,\n",
      "consists in the principle of representation; which is the pivot on\n",
      "which the former move, and which is supposed to have been unknown to the\n",
      "latter, or at least to the ancient part of them. The use which has been\n",
      "made of this difference, in reasonings contained in former papers,\n",
      "will have shown that I am disposed neither to deny its existence nor\n",
      "to undervalue its importance. I feel the less restraint, therefore, in\n",
      "observing, that the position concerning the ignorance of the ancient\n",
      "governments on the subject of representation, is by no means precisely\n",
      "true in the latitude commonly given to it. Without entering into a\n",
      "disquisition which here would be misplaced, I will refer to a few known\n",
      "facts, in support of what I advance.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the most pure democracies of Greece, many of the executive functions\n",
      "were performed, not by the people themselves, but by officers elected by\n",
      "the people, and REPRESENTING the people in their EXECUTIVE capacity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prior to the reform of Solon, Athens was governed by nine Archons,\n",
      "annually ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE AT LARGE. The degree of power delegated\n",
      "to them seems to be left in great obscurity. Subsequent to that period,\n",
      "we find an assembly, first of four, and afterwards of six hundred\n",
      "members, annually ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE; and PARTIALLY representing them\n",
      "in their LEGISLATIVE capacity, since they were not only associated with\n",
      "the people in the function of making laws, but had the exclusive right\n",
      "of originating legislative propositions to the people. The senate of\n",
      "Carthage, also, whatever might be its power, or the duration of its\n",
      "appointment, appears to have been ELECTIVE by the suffrages of the\n",
      "people. Similar instances might be traced in most, if not all the\n",
      "popular governments of antiquity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, in Sparta we meet with the Ephori, and in Rome with the\n",
      "Tribunes; two bodies, small indeed in numbers, but annually ELECTED BY\n",
      "THE WHOLE BODY OF THE PEOPLE, and considered as the REPRESENTATIVES of\n",
      "the people, almost in their PLENIPOTENTIARY capacity. The Cosmi of Crete\n",
      "were also annually ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE, and have been considered by\n",
      "some authors as an institution analogous to those of Sparta and Rome,\n",
      "with this difference only, that in the election of that representative\n",
      "body the right of suffrage was communicated to a part only of the\n",
      "people.\n",
      "\n",
      "From these facts, to which many others might be added, it is clear that\n",
      "the principle of representation was neither unknown to the ancients nor\n",
      "wholly overlooked in their political constitutions. The true distinction\n",
      "between these and the American governments, lies IN THE TOTAL EXCLUSION\n",
      "OF THE PEOPLE, IN THEIR COLLECTIVE CAPACITY, from any share in the\n",
      "LATTER, and not in the TOTAL EXCLUSION OF THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE\n",
      "PEOPLE from the administration of the FORMER. The distinction,\n",
      "however, thus qualified, must be admitted to leave a most advantageous\n",

      "observed, must in the first place corrupt itself; must next corrupt the\n",
      "State legislatures; must then corrupt the House of Representatives; and\n",
      "must finally corrupt the people at large. It is evident that the Senate\n",
      "must be first corrupted before it can attempt an establishment of\n",
      "tyranny. Without corrupting the State legislatures, it cannot prosecute\n",
      "the attempt, because the periodical change of members would otherwise\n",
      "regenerate the whole body. Without exerting the means of corruption with\n",
      "equal success on the House of Representatives, the opposition of that\n",
      "coequal branch of the government would inevitably defeat the attempt;\n",
      "and without corrupting the people themselves, a succession of new\n",
      "representatives would speedily restore all things to their pristine\n",
      "order. Is there any man who can seriously persuade himself that the\n",
      "proposed Senate can, by any possible means within the compass of human\n",
      "address, arrive at the object of a lawless ambition, through all these\n",
      "obstructions?\n",
      "\n",
      "If reason condemns the suspicion, the same sentence is pronounced by\n",
      "experience. The constitution of Maryland furnishes the most apposite\n",
      "example. The Senate of that State is elected, as the federal Senate will\n",
      "be, indirectly by the people, and for a term less by one year only\n",
      "than the federal Senate. It is distinguished, also, by the remarkable\n",
      "prerogative of filling up its own vacancies within the term of its\n",
      "appointment, and, at the same time, is not under the control of any such\n",
      "rotation as is provided for the federal Senate. There are some other\n",
      "lesser distinctions, which would expose the former to colorable\n",
      "objections, that do not lie against the latter. If the federal Senate,\n",
      "therefore, really contained the danger which has been so loudly\n",
      "proclaimed, some symptoms at least of a like danger ought by this time\n",
      "to have been betrayed by the Senate of Maryland, but no such symptoms\n",
      "have appeared. On the contrary, the jealousies at first entertained\n",
      "by men of the same description with those who view with terror the\n",
      "correspondent part of the federal Constitution, have been gradually\n",
      "extinguished by the progress of the experiment; and the Maryland\n",
      "constitution is daily deriving, from the salutary operation of this part\n",
      "of it, a reputation in which it will probably not be rivalled by that of\n",
      "any State in the Union.\n",
      "\n",
      "But if anything could silence the jealousies on this subject, it ought\n",
      "to be the British example. The Senate there instead of being elected for\n",
      "a term of six years, and of being unconfined to particular families\n",
      "or fortunes, is an hereditary assembly of opulent nobles. The House\n",
      "of Representatives, instead of being elected for two years, and by the\n",
      "whole body of the people, is elected for seven years, and, in very\n",
      "great proportion, by a very small proportion of the people. Here,\n",
      "unquestionably, ought to be seen in full display the aristocratic\n",
      "usurpations and tyranny which are at some future period to be\n",
      "exemplified in the United States. Unfortunately, however, for the\n",
      "anti-federal argument, the British history informs us that this\n",
      "hereditary assembly has not been able to defend itself against the\n",
      "continual encroachments of the House of Representatives; and that it no\n",
      "sooner lost the support of the monarch, than it was actually crushed by\n",
      "the weight of the popular branch.\n",
      "\n",
      "As far as antiquity can instruct us on this subject, its examples\n",
      "support the reasoning which we have employed. In Sparta, the Ephori, the\n",
      "annual representatives of the people, were found an overmatch for the\n",
      "senate for life, continually gained on its authority and finally drew\n",
      "all power into their own hands. The Tribunes of Rome, who were the\n",
      "representatives of the people, prevailed, it is well known, in almost\n",
      "every contest with the senate for life, and in the end gained the most\n",
      "complete triumph over it. The fact is the more remarkable, as unanimity\n",
      "was required in every act of the Tribunes, even after their number was\n",
      "augmented to ten. It proves the irresistible force possessed by that\n",
      "branch of a free government, which has the people on its side. To these\n",
      "examples might be added that of Carthage, whose senate, according to\n",
      "the testimony of Polybius, instead of drawing all power into its vortex,\n",
      "had, at the commencement of the second Punic War, lost almost the whole\n",
      "of its original portion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides the conclusive evidence resulting from this assemblage of facts,\n",
      "that the federal Senate will never be able to transform itself, by\n",
      "gradual usurpations, into an independent and aristocratic body, we are\n",
      "warranted in believing, that if such a revolution should ever happen\n",
      "from causes which the foresight of man cannot guard against, the House\n",
      "of Representatives, with the people on their side, will at all times\n",
      "be able to bring back the Constitution to its primitive form and\n",

      "Although the absolute necessity of system, in the conduct of any\n",
      "business, is universally known and acknowledged, yet the high importance\n",

      "the public mind. They who wish to commit the power under consideration\n",

      "opposite to our wishes. As in the field, so in the cabinet, there are\n",
      "moments to be seized as they pass, and they who preside in either should\n",
      "be left in capacity to improve them. So often and so essentially have\n",
      "we heretofore suffered from the want of secrecy and despatch, that the\n",

      "the negotiation. For these, the President will find no difficulty to\n",
      "provide; and should any circumstance occur which requires the advice and\n",
      "consent of the Senate, he may at any time convene them. Thus we see that\n",
      "the Constitution provides that our negotiations for treaties shall\n",

      "of laws, they should be made only by men invested with legislative\n",
      "authority. These gentlemen seem not to consider that the judgments of\n",
      "our courts, and the commissions constitutionally given by our governor,\n",
      "are as valid and as binding on all persons whom they concern, as the\n",
      "laws passed by our legislature. All constitutional acts of power,\n",
      "whether in the executive or in the judicial department, have as much\n",
      "legal validity and obligation as if they proceeded from the legislature;\n",
      "and therefore, whatever name be given to the power of making treaties,\n",
      "or however obligatory they may be when made, certain it is, that the\n",
      "people may, with much propriety, commit the power to a distinct body\n",
      "from the legislature, the executive, or the judicial. It surely does\n",
      "not follow, that because they have given the power of making laws to the\n",
      "legislature, that therefore they should likewise give them the power to\n",
      "do every other act of sovereignty by which the citizens are to be bound\n",

      "\n",
      "Others, though content that treaties should be made in the mode\n",

      "insist, and profess to believe, that treaties like acts of assembly,\n",
      "should be repealable at pleasure. This idea seems to be new and peculiar\n",
      "to this country, but new errors, as well as new truths, often appear.\n",
      "These gentlemen would do well to reflect that a treaty is only another\n",
      "name for a bargain, and that it would be impossible to find a nation\n",
      "who would make any bargain with us, which should be binding on them\n",
      "ABSOLUTELY, but on us only so long and so far as we may think proper to\n",

      "or cancel them; but still let us not forget that treaties are made, not\n",
      "by only one of the contracting parties, but by both; and consequently,\n",
      "that as the consent of both was essential to their formation at first,\n",
      "so must it ever afterwards be to alter or cancel them. The proposed\n",
      "Constitution, therefore, has not in the least extended the obligation\n",
      "of treaties. They are just as binding, and just as far beyond the lawful\n",

      "in such cases there will always be the greatest danger that the decision\n",

      "of periodical elections, will as readily be perceived, when it is\n",
      "considered that the most conspicuous characters in it will, from that\n",
      "circumstance, be too often the leaders or the tools of the most cunning\n",
      "or the most numerous faction, and on this account, can hardly be\n",

      "may be the subject of scrutiny.\n",

      "The convention, it appears, thought the Senate the most fit depositary\n",
      "of this important trust. Those who can best discern the intrinsic\n",

      "themselves? It is not disputed that the power of originating the\n",
      "inquiry, or, in other words, of preferring the impeachment, ought to be\n",
      "lodged in the hands of one branch of the legislative body. Will not the\n",
      "reasons which indicate the propriety of this arrangement strongly plead\n",
      "for an admission of the other branch of that body to a share of the\n",
      "inquiry? The model from which the idea of this institution has been\n",
      "borrowed, pointed out that course to the convention. In Great Britain it\n",
      "is the province of the House of Commons to prefer the impeachment,\n",
      "and of the House of Lords to decide upon it. Several of the State\n",
      "constitutions have followed the example. As well the latter, as the\n",
      "former, seem to have regarded the practice of impeachments as a bridle\n",
      "in the hands of the legislative body upon the executive servants of the\n",
      "government. Is not this the true light in which it ought to be regarded?\n",
      "\n",
      "Where else than in the Senate could have been found a tribunal\n",
      "sufficiently dignified, or sufficiently independent? What other body\n",
      "would be likely to feel CONFIDENCE ENOUGH IN ITS OWN SITUATION, to\n",

      "tribunal would at all times be endowed with so eminent a portion of\n",
      "fortitude, as would be called for in the execution of so difficult a\n",
      "task; and it is still more to be doubted, whether they would possess the\n",
      "degree of credit and authority, which might, on certain occasions, be\n",
      "indispensable towards reconciling the people to a decision that\n",
      "should happen to clash with an accusation brought by their immediate\n",
      "representatives. A deficiency in the first, would be fatal to the\n",
      "accused; in the last, dangerous to the public tranquillity. The hazard\n",
      "in both these respects, could only be avoided, if at all, by rendering\n",
      "that tribunal more numerous than would consist with a reasonable\n",
      "attention to economy. The necessity of a numerous court for the trial of\n",
      "impeachments, is equally dictated by the nature of the proceeding. This\n",
      "can never be tied down by such strict rules, either in the delineation\n",
      "of the offense by the prosecutors, or in the construction of it by the\n",
      "judges, as in common cases serve to limit the discretion of courts in\n",
      "favor of personal security. There will be no jury to stand between the\n",
      "judges who are to pronounce the sentence of the law, and the party\n",
      "who is to receive or suffer it. The awful discretion which a court of\n",
      "impeachments must necessarily have, to doom to honor or to infamy\n",

      "These considerations seem alone sufficient to authorize a conclusion,\n",
      "that the Supreme Court would have been an improper substitute for\n",
      "the Senate, as a court of impeachments. There remains a further\n",
      "consideration, which will not a little strengthen this conclusion. It\n",
      "is this: The punishment which may be the consequence of conviction upon\n",
      "impeachment, is not to terminate the chastisement of the offender.\n",
      "After having been sentenced to a perpetual ostracism from the esteem and\n",
      "confidence, and honors and emoluments of his country, he will still\n",
      "be liable to prosecution and punishment in the ordinary course of law.\n",
      "Would it be proper that the persons who had disposed of his fame, and\n",
      "his most valuable rights as a citizen in one trial, should, in another\n",
      "trial, for the same offense, be also the disposers of his life and\n",
      "his fortune? Would there not be the greatest reason to apprehend, that\n",
      "error, in the first sentence, would be the parent of error in the second\n",
      "sentence? That the strong bias of one decision would be apt to overrule\n",
      "the influence of any new lights which might be brought to vary the\n",
      "complexion of another decision? Those who know anything of human nature,\n",
      "will not hesitate to answer these questions in the affirmative; and will\n",
      "be at no loss to perceive, that by making the same persons judges in\n",
      "both cases, those who might happen to be the objects of prosecution\n",
      "would, in a great measure, be deprived of the double security intended\n",
      "them by a double trial. The loss of life and estate would often be\n",
      "virtually included in a sentence which, in its terms, imported nothing\n",
      "more than dismission from a present, and disqualification for a future,\n",
      "office. It may be said, that the intervention of a jury, in the second\n",
      "instance, would obviate the danger. But juries are frequently influenced\n",
      "by the opinions of judges. They are sometimes induced to find special\n",
      "verdicts, which refer the main question to the decision of the court.\n",
      "Who would be willing to stake his life and his estate upon the verdict\n",
      "of a jury acting under the auspices of judges who had predetermined his\n",
      "guilt?\n",
      "\n",
      "Would it have been an improvement of the plan, to have united the\n",
      "Supreme Court with the Senate, in the formation of the court of\n",
      "impeachments? This union would certainly have been attended with several\n",
      "advantages; but would they not have been overbalanced by the signal\n",

      "Would it have been desirable to have composed the court for the trial of\n",
      "impeachments, of persons wholly distinct from the other departments\n",
      "of the government? There are weighty arguments, as well against, as\n",
      "in favor of, such a plan. To some minds it will not appear a trivial\n",
      "objection, that it could tend to increase the complexity of the\n",
      "political machine, and to add a new spring to the government, the\n",
      "utility of which would at best be questionable. But an objection which\n",
      "will not be thought by any unworthy of attention, is this: a court\n",
      "formed upon such a plan, would either be attended with a heavy\n",
      "expense, or might in practice be subject to a variety of casualties and\n",
      "inconveniences. It must either consist of permanent officers, stationary\n",
      "at the seat of government, and of course entitled to fixed and regular\n",
      "stipends, or of certain officers of the State governments to be called\n",
      "upon whenever an impeachment was actually depending. It will not be easy\n",
      "to imagine any third mode materially different, which could rationally\n",
      "be proposed. As the court, for reasons already given, ought to be\n",
      "numerous, the first scheme will be reprobated by every man who can\n",
      "compare the extent of the public wants with the means of supplying them.\n",
      "The second will be espoused with caution by those who will seriously\n",
      "consider the difficulty of collecting men dispersed over the whole\n",
      "Union; the injury to the innocent, from the procrastinated determination\n",
      "of the charges which might be brought against them; the advantage to the\n",
      "guilty, from the opportunities which delay would afford to intrigue\n",
      "and corruption; and in some cases the detriment to the State, from the\n",
      "prolonged inaction of men whose firm and faithful execution of their\n",
      "duty might have exposed them to the persecution of an intemperate or\n",
      "designing majority in the House of Representatives. Though this\n",
      "latter supposition may seem harsh, and might not be likely often to be\n",

      "eradicate the remains of any unfavorable impressions which may still\n",
      "exist in regard to this matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The FIRST of these objections is, that the provision in question\n",
      "confounds legislative and judiciary authorities in the same body, in\n",
      "violation of that important and well-established maxim which requires a\n",
      "separation between the different departments of power. The true meaning\n",
      "of this maxim has been discussed and ascertained in another place, and\n",
      "has been shown to be entirely compatible with a partial intermixture of\n",
      "those departments for special purposes, preserving them, in the main,\n",
      "distinct and unconnected. This partial intermixture is even, in some\n",
      "cases, not only proper but necessary to the mutual defense of the\n",
      "several members of the government against each other. An absolute or\n",
      "qualified negative in the executive upon the acts of the legislative\n",
      "body, is admitted, by the ablest adepts in political science, to be an\n",
      "indispensable barrier against the encroachments of the latter upon the\n",
      "former. And it may, perhaps, with no less reason be contended, that the\n",
      "powers relating to impeachments are, as before intimated, an essential\n",
      "check in the hands of that body upon the encroachments of the executive.\n",
      "The division of them between the two branches of the legislature,\n",
      "assigning to one the right of accusing, to the other the right of\n",
      "judging, avoids the inconvenience of making the same persons both\n",

      "a condemnation, the security to innocence, from this additional\n",
      "circumstance, will be as complete as itself can desire.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is curious to observe, with what vehemence this part of the plan is\n",
      "assailed, on the principle here taken notice of, by men who profess to\n",
      "admire, without exception, the constitution of this State; while that\n",
      "constitution makes the Senate, together with the chancellor and judges\n",
      "of the Supreme Court, not only a court of impeachments, but the\n",
      "highest judicatory in the State, in all causes, civil and criminal. The\n",
      "proportion, in point of numbers, of the chancellor and judges to the\n",
      "senators, is so inconsiderable, that the judiciary authority of New\n",
      "York, in the last resort, may, with truth, be said to reside in its\n",
      "Senate. If the plan of the convention be, in this respect, chargeable\n",
      "with a departure from the celebrated maxim which has been so often\n",
      "mentioned, and seems to be so little understood, how much more culpable\n",
      "must be the constitution of New York?(1)\n",
      "\n",
      "A SECOND objection to the Senate, as a court of impeachments, is, that\n",
      "it contributes to an undue accumulation of power in that body, tending\n",
      "to give to the government a countenance too aristocratic. The Senate, it\n",
      "is observed, is to have concurrent authority with the Executive in the\n",
      "formation of treaties and in the appointment to offices: if, say the\n",
      "objectors, to these prerogatives is added that of deciding in all\n",
      "cases of impeachment, it will give a decided predominancy to senatorial\n",
      "influence. To an objection so little precise in itself, it is not easy\n",
      "to find a very precise answer. Where is the measure or criterion to\n",
      "which we can appeal, for determining what will give the Senate too much,\n",
      "too little, or barely the proper degree of influence? Will it not be\n",
      "more safe, as well as more simple, to dismiss such vague and uncertain\n",
      "calculations, to examine each power by itself, and to decide, on general\n",
      "principles, where it may be deposited with most advantage and least\n",
      "inconvenience?\n",
      "\n",
      "If we take this course, it will lead to a more intelligible, if not to\n",
      "a more certain result. The disposition of the power of making treaties,\n",
      "which has obtained in the plan of the convention, will, then, if I\n",
      "mistake not, appear to be fully justified by the considerations stated\n",
      "in a former number, and by others which will occur under the next head\n",
      "of our inquiries. The expediency of the junction of the Senate with\n",
      "the Executive, in the power of appointing to offices, will, I trust, be\n",
      "placed in a light not less satisfactory, in the disquisitions under the\n",
      "same head. And I flatter myself the observations in my last paper must\n",
      "have gone no inconsiderable way towards proving that it was not easy, if\n",
      "practicable, to find a more fit receptacle for the power of determining\n",
      "impeachments, than that which has been chosen. If this be truly the\n",
      "case, the hypothetical dread of the too great weight of the Senate ought\n",
      "to be discarded from our reasonings.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this hypothesis, such as it is, has already been refuted in the\n",
      "remarks applied to the duration in office prescribed for the senators.\n",
      "It was by them shown, as well on the credit of historical examples,\n",
      "as from the reason of the thing, that the most POPULAR branch of every\n",
      "government, partaking of the republican genius, by being generally the\n",
      "favorite of the people, will be as generally a full match, if not an\n",
      "overmatch, for every other member of the Government.\n",
      "\n",
      "But independent of this most active and operative principle, to secure\n",
      "the equilibrium of the national House of Representatives, the plan of\n",
      "the convention has provided in its favor several important counterpoises\n",
      "to the additional authorities to be conferred upon the Senate. The\n",
      "exclusive privilege of originating money bills will belong to the\n",
      "House of Representatives. The same house will possess the sole right of\n",
      "instituting impeachments: is not this a complete counterbalance to that\n",
      "of determining them? The same house will be the umpire in all elections\n",
      "of the President, which do not unite the suffrages of a majority of\n",
      "the whole number of electors; a case which it cannot be doubted will\n",
      "sometimes, if not frequently, happen. The constant possibility of the\n",
      "thing must be a fruitful source of influence to that body. The more it\n",
      "is contemplated, the more important will appear this ultimate though\n",
      "contingent power, of deciding the competitions of the most illustrious\n",
      "citizens of the Union, for the first office in it. It would not perhaps\n",
      "be rash to predict, that as a mean of influence it will be found to\n",
      "outweigh all the peculiar attributes of the Senate.\n",
      "\n",
      "A THIRD objection to the Senate as a court of impeachments, is drawn\n",
      "from the agency they are to have in the appointments to office. It is\n",
      "imagined that they would be too indulgent judges of the conduct of men,\n",
      "in whose official creation they had participated. The principle of this\n",
      "objection would condemn a practice, which is to be seen in all the State\n",
      "governments, if not in all the governments with which we are acquainted:\n",
      "I mean that of rendering those who hold offices during pleasure,\n",
      "dependent on the pleasure of those who appoint them. With equal\n",
      "plausibility might it be alleged in this case, that the favoritism of\n",
      "the latter would always be an asylum for the misbehavior of the former.\n",
      "But that practice, in contradiction to this principle, proceeds upon\n",
      "the presumption, that the responsibility of those who appoint, for the\n",
      "fitness and competency of the persons on whom they bestow their choice,\n",
      "and the interest they will have in the respectable and prosperous\n",
      "administration of affairs, will inspire a sufficient disposition to\n",
      "dismiss from a share in it all such who, by their conduct, shall have\n",
      "proved themselves unworthy of the confidence reposed in them. Though\n",
      "facts may not always correspond with this presumption, yet if it be,\n",
      "in the main, just, it must destroy the supposition that the Senate, who\n",
      "will merely sanction the choice of the Executive, should feel a bias,\n",
      "towards the objects of that choice, strong enough to blind them to\n",
      "the evidences of guilt so extraordinary, as to have induced the\n",
      "representatives of the nation to become its accusers.\n",
      "\n",
      "If any further arguments were necessary to evince the improbability of\n",
      "such a bias, it might be found in the nature of the agency of the Senate\n",
      "in the business of appointments. It will be the office of the President\n",
      "to NOMINATE, and, with the advice and consent of the Senate, to APPOINT.\n",
      "There will, of course, be no exertion of CHOICE on the part of the\n",
      "Senate. They may defeat one choice of the Executive, and oblige him to\n",
      "make another; but they cannot themselves CHOOSE--they can only ratify\n",
      "or reject the choice of the President. They might even entertain a\n",
      "preference to some other person, at the very moment they were assenting\n",
      "to the one proposed, because there might be no positive ground of\n",
      "opposition to him; and they could not be sure, if they withheld their\n",
      "assent, that the subsequent nomination would fall upon their own\n",
      "favorite, or upon any other person in their estimation more meritorious\n",
      "than the one rejected. Thus it could hardly happen, that the majority\n",
      "of the Senate would feel any other complacency towards the object of an\n",
      "appointment than such as the appearances of merit might inspire, and the\n",
      "proofs of the want of it destroy.\n",
      "\n",
      "A FOURTH objection to the Senate in the capacity of a court of\n",
      "impeachments, is derived from its union with the Executive in the\n",
      "power of making treaties. This, it has been said, would constitute the\n",

      "The last of these two clauses, it is equally clear, cannot be understood\n",

      "the other, for the purpose of establishing an auxiliary method of\n",
      "appointment, in cases to which the general method was inadequate. The\n",
      "ordinary power of appointment is confined to the President and Senate\n",
      "JOINTLY, and can therefore only be exercised during the session of the\n",
      "Senate; but as it would have been improper to oblige this body to be\n",
      "continually in session for the appointment of officers and as vacancies\n",
      "might happen IN THEIR RECESS, which it might be necessary for the\n",
      "public service to fill without delay, the succeeding clause is\n",
      "evidently intended to authorize the President, SINGLY, to make temporary\n",
      "appointments \"during the recess of the Senate, by granting commissions\n",
      "which shall expire at the end of their next session.\" Second. If this\n",
      "clause is to be considered as supplementary to the one which precedes,\n",
      "the VACANCIES of which it speaks must be construed to relate to the\n",
      "\"officers\" described in the preceding one; and this, we have seen,\n",
      "excludes from its description the members of the Senate. Third. The time\n",
      "within which the power is to operate, \"during the recess of the Senate,\"\n",
      "and the duration of the appointments, \"to the end of the next session\"\n",
      "of that body, conspire to elucidate the sense of the provision, which,\n",
      "if it had been intended to comprehend senators, would naturally have\n",
      "referred the temporary power of filling vacancies to the recess of the\n",
      "State legislatures, who are to make the permanent appointments, and\n",
      "not to the recess of the national Senate, who are to have no concern in\n",
      "those appointments; and would have extended the duration in office of\n",
      "the temporary senators to the next session of the legislature of the\n",
      "State, in whose representation the vacancies had happened, instead of\n",
      "making it to expire at the end of the ensuing session of the national\n",
      "Senate. The circumstances of the body authorized to make the permanent\n",
      "appointments would, of course, have governed the modification of a power\n",
      "which related to the temporary appointments; and as the national Senate\n",
      "is the body, whose situation is alone contemplated in the clause upon\n",
      "which the suggestion under examination has been founded, the vacancies\n",
      "to which it alludes can only be deemed to respect those officers in\n",
      "whose appointment that body has a concurrent agency with the President.\n",
      "But last, the first and second clauses of the third section of the first\n",
      "article, not only obviate all possibility of doubt, but destroy the\n",
      "pretext of misconception. The former provides, that \"the Senate of the\n",
      "United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State, chosen\n",
      "BY THE LEGISLATURE THEREOF for six years\"; and the latter directs, that,\n",
      "\"if vacancies in that body should happen by resignation or otherwise,\n",

      "extraordinary or violent movements, than the choice of ONE who was\n",
      "himself to be the final object of the public wishes. And as the\n",
      "electors, chosen in each State, are to assemble and vote in the State in\n",
      "which they are chosen, this detached and divided situation will expose\n",
      "them much less to heats and ferments, which might be communicated from\n",
      "them to the people, than if they were all to be convened at one time, in\n",
      "one place.\n",

      "Nothing was more to be desired than that every practicable obstacle\n",
      "should be opposed to cabal, intrigue, and corruption. These most deadly\n",
      "adversaries of republican government might naturally have been expected\n",
      "to make their approaches from more than one quarter, but chiefly from\n",
      "the desire in foreign powers to gain an improper ascendant in our\n",
      "councils. How could they better gratify this, than by raising a creature\n",
      "of their own to the chief magistracy of the Union? But the convention\n",
      "have guarded against all danger of this sort, with the most provident\n",
      "and judicious attention. They have not made the appointment of the\n",
      "President to depend on any preexisting bodies of men, who might be\n",
      "tampered with beforehand to prostitute their votes; but they have\n",
      "referred it in the first instance to an immediate act of the people of\n",
      "America, to be exerted in the choice of persons for the temporary and\n",
      "sole purpose of making the appointment. And they have excluded from\n",
      "eligibility to this trust, all those who from situation might be\n",
      "suspected of too great devotion to the President in office. No senator,\n",
      "representative, or other person holding a place of trust or profit under\n",

      "will at least enter upon the task free from any sinister bias. Their\n",
      "transient existence, and their detached situation, already taken notice\n",
      "of, afford a satisfactory prospect of their continuing so, to the\n",
      "conclusion of it. The business of corruption, when it is to embrace so\n",

      "Another and no less important desideratum was, that the Executive should\n",

      "Lieutenant-Governor, chosen by the people at large, who presides in\n",

      "I PROCEED now to trace the real characters of the proposed Executive,\n",
      "as they are marked out in the plan of the convention. This will serve to\n",
      "place in a strong light the unfairness of the representations which have\n",
      "been made in regard to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first thing which strikes our attention is, that the executive\n",
      "authority, with few exceptions, is to be vested in a single magistrate.\n",
      "This will scarcely, however, be considered as a point upon which any\n",
      "comparison can be grounded; for if, in this particular, there be\n",
      "a resemblance to the king of Great Britain, there is not less a\n",
      "resemblance to the Grand Seignior, to the khan of Tartary, to the Man of\n",
      "the Seven Mountains, or to the governor of New York.\n",
      "\n",
      "That magistrate is to be elected for four years; and is to be\n",
      "re-eligible as often as the people of the United States shall think\n",
      "him worthy of their confidence. In these circumstances there is a\n",
      "total dissimilitude between him and a king of Great Britain, who is an\n",
      "hereditary monarch, possessing the crown as a patrimony descendible\n",
      "to his heirs forever; but there is a close analogy between him and a\n",
      "governor of New York, who is elected for three years, and is re-eligible\n",
      "without limitation or intermission. If we consider how much less time\n",
      "would be requisite for establishing a dangerous influence in a single\n",
      "State, than for establishing a like influence throughout the United\n",
      "States, we must conclude that a duration of four years for the Chief\n",
      "Magistrate of the Union is a degree of permanency far less to be dreaded\n",
      "in that office, than a duration of three years for a corresponding\n",

      "or misdemeanors, removed from office; and would afterwards be liable to\n",
      "prosecution and punishment in the ordinary course of law. The person\n",
      "of the king of Great Britain is sacred and inviolable; there is no\n",
      "constitutional tribunal to which he is amenable; no punishment to\n",
      "which he can be subjected without involving the crisis of a national\n",

      "The President of the United States is to have power to return a bill,\n",

      "that reconsideration, it be approved by two thirds of both houses. The\n",
      "king of Great Britain, on his part, has an absolute negative upon the\n",
      "acts of the two houses of Parliament. The disuse of that power for a\n",
      "considerable time past does not affect the reality of its existence;\n",
      "and is to be ascribed wholly to the crown's having found the means of\n",
      "substituting influence to authority, or the art of gaining a majority\n",
      "in one or the other of the two houses, to the necessity of exerting a\n",
      "prerogative which could seldom be exerted without hazarding some degree\n",
      "of national agitation. The qualified negative of the President differs\n",
      "widely from this absolute negative of the British sovereign; and tallies\n",
      "exactly with the revisionary authority of the council of revision of\n",
      "this State, of which the governor is a constituent part. In this respect\n",
      "the power of the President would exceed that of the governor of New\n",
      "York, because the former would possess, singly, what the latter shares\n",
      "with the chancellor and judges; but it would be precisely the same with\n",

      "The President is to be the \"commander-in-chief of the army and navy of\n",
      "the United States, and of the militia of the several States, when called\n",
      "into the actual service of the United States. He is to have power to\n",
      "grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States,\n",
      "except in cases of impeachment; to recommend to the consideration of\n",
      "Congress such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient; to\n",
      "convene, on extraordinary occasions, both houses of the legislature, or\n",
      "either of them, and, in case of disagreement between them with respect\n",
      "to the time of adjournment, to adjourn them to such time as he shall\n",
      "think proper; to take care that the laws be faithfully executed; and\n",
      "to commission all officers of the United States.\" In most of these\n",
      "particulars, the power of the President will resemble equally that of\n",
      "the king of Great Britain and of the governor of New York. The most\n",
      "material points of difference are these:--First. The President will have\n",
      "only the occasional command of such part of the militia of the nation\n",
      "as by legislative provision may be called into the actual service of the\n",
      "Union. The king of Great Britain and the governor of New York have at\n",
      "all times the entire command of all the militia within their several\n",
      "jurisdictions. In this article, therefore, the power of the President\n",
      "would be inferior to that of either the monarch or the governor. Second.\n",
      "The President is to be commander-in-chief of the army and navy of the\n",
      "United States. In this respect his authority would be nominally the same\n",
      "with that of the king of Great Britain, but in substance much inferior\n",
      "to it. It would amount to nothing more than the supreme command and\n",
      "direction of the military and naval forces, as first General and admiral\n",
      "of the Confederacy; while that of the British king extends to the\n",
      "declaring of war and to the raising and regulating of fleets and\n",
      "armies--all which, by the Constitution under consideration, would\n",
      "appertain to the legislature.(1) The governor of New York, on the other\n",
      "hand, is by the constitution of the State vested only with the command\n",
      "of its militia and navy. But the constitutions of several of the States\n",
      "expressly declare their governors to be commanders-in-chief, as well of\n",
      "the army as navy; and it may well be a question, whether those of New\n",
      "Hampshire and Massachusetts, in particular, do not, in this instance,\n",
      "confer larger powers upon their respective governors, than could be\n",
      "claimed by a President of the United States. Third. The power of the\n",
      "President, in respect to pardons, would extend to all cases, except\n",
      "those of impeachment. The governor of New York may pardon in all cases,\n",
      "even in those of impeachment, except for treason and murder. Is not the\n",
      "power of the governor, in this article, on a calculation of political\n",
      "consequences, greater than that of the President? All conspiracies and\n",
      "plots against the government, which have not been matured into\n",
      "actual treason, may be screened from punishment of every kind, by the\n",
      "interposition of the prerogative of pardoning. If a governor of New\n",
      "York, therefore, should be at the head of any such conspiracy, until\n",
      "the design had been ripened into actual hostility he could insure his\n",
      "accomplices and adherents an entire impunity. A President of the Union,\n",
      "on the other hand, though he may even pardon treason, when prosecuted\n",
      "in the ordinary course of law, could shelter no offender, in any degree,\n",
      "from the effects of impeachment and conviction. Would not the prospect\n",
      "of a total indemnity for all the preliminary steps be a greater\n",
      "temptation to undertake and persevere in an enterprise against the\n",
      "public liberty, than the mere prospect of an exemption from death and\n",
      "confiscation, if the final execution of the design, upon an actual\n",
      "appeal to arms, should miscarry? Would this last expectation have any\n",
      "influence at all, when the probability was computed, that the person\n",
      "who was to afford that exemption might himself be involved in the\n",
      "consequences of the measure, and might be incapacitated by his agency\n",
      "in it from affording the desired impunity? The better to judge of\n",
      "this matter, it will be necessary to recollect, that, by the proposed\n",
      "Constitution, the offense of treason is limited \"to levying war upon\n",
      "the United States, and adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and\n",
      "comfort\"; and that by the laws of New York it is confined within similar\n",
      "bounds. Fourth. The President can only adjourn the national legislature\n",
      "in the single case of disagreement about the time of adjournment.\n",
      "The British monarch may prorogue or even dissolve the Parliament. The\n",
      "governor of New York may also prorogue the legislature of this State for\n",
      "a limited time; a power which, in certain situations, may be employed to\n",
      "very important purposes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President is to have power, with the advice and consent of the\n",
      "Senate, to make treaties, provided two thirds of the senators\n",
      "present concur. The king of Great Britain is the sole and absolute\n",
      "representative of the nation in all foreign transactions. He can of\n",
      "his own accord make treaties of peace, commerce, alliance, and of every\n",
      "other description. It has been insinuated, that his authority in this\n",
      "respect is not conclusive, and that his conventions with foreign powers\n",
      "are subject to the revision, and stand in need of the ratification, of\n",
      "Parliament. But I believe this doctrine was never heard of, until it was\n",
      "broached upon the present occasion. Every jurist(2) of that kingdom,\n",
      "and every other man acquainted with its Constitution, knows, as an\n",
      "established fact, that the prerogative of making treaties exists in the\n",
      "crown in its utmost plentitude; and that the compacts entered into\n",
      "by the royal authority have the most complete legal validity and\n",
      "perfection, independent of any other sanction. The Parliament, it is\n",
      "true, is sometimes seen employing itself in altering the existing laws\n",
      "to conform them to the stipulations in a new treaty; and this may have\n",
      "possibly given birth to the imagination, that its co-operation\n",
      "was necessary to the obligatory efficacy of the treaty. But this\n",
      "parliamentary interposition proceeds from a different cause: from the\n",
      "necessity of adjusting a most artificial and intricate system of revenue\n",
      "and commercial laws, to the changes made in them by the operation of the\n",
      "treaty; and of adapting new provisions and precautions to the new state\n",
      "of things, to keep the machine from running into disorder. In this\n",
      "respect, therefore, there is no comparison between the intended power of\n",
      "the President and the actual power of the British sovereign. The one\n",
      "can perform alone what the other can do only with the concurrence of a\n",
      "branch of the legislature. It must be admitted, that, in this instance,\n",
      "the power of the federal Executive would exceed that of any State\n",
      "Executive. But this arises naturally from the sovereign power which\n",
      "relates to treaties. If the Confederacy were to be dissolved, it would\n",
      "become a question, whether the Executives of the several States were not\n",
      "solely invested with that delicate and important prerogative.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President is also to be authorized to receive ambassadors and other\n",
      "public ministers. This, though it has been a rich theme of declamation,\n",
      "is more a matter of dignity than of authority. It is a circumstance\n",
      "which will be without consequence in the administration of the\n",
      "government; and it was far more convenient that it should be arranged\n",
      "in this manner, than that there should be a necessity of convening the\n",
      "legislature, or one of its branches, upon every arrival of a foreign\n",
      "minister, though it were merely to take the place of a departed\n",
      "predecessor.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President is to nominate, and, with the advice and consent of the\n",
      "Senate, to appoint ambassadors and other public ministers, judges of\n",
      "the Supreme Court, and in general all officers of the United States\n",
      "established by law, and whose appointments are not otherwise provided\n",
      "for by the Constitution. The king of Great Britain is emphatically and\n",
      "truly styled the fountain of honor. He not only appoints to all offices,\n",
      "but can create offices. He can confer titles of nobility at pleasure;\n",
      "and has the disposal of an immense number of church preferments. There\n",
      "is evidently a great inferiority in the power of the President, in this\n",
      "particular, to that of the British king; nor is it equal to that of\n",
      "the governor of New York, if we are to interpret the meaning of the\n",
      "constitution of the State by the practice which has obtained under it.\n",
      "The power of appointment is with us lodged in a council, composed of\n",
      "the governor and four members of the Senate, chosen by the Assembly. The\n",
      "governor claims, and has frequently exercised, the right of nomination,\n",
      "and is entitled to a casting vote in the appointment. If he really has\n",
      "the right of nominating, his authority is in this respect equal to that\n",
      "of the President, and exceeds it in the article of the casting vote. In\n",
      "the national government, if the Senate should be divided, no appointment\n",
      "could be made; in the government of New York, if the council should\n",
      "be divided, the governor can turn the scale, and confirm his own\n",
      "nomination.(3) If we compare the publicity which must necessarily attend\n",
      "the mode of appointment by the President and an entire branch of the\n",
      "national legislature, with the privacy in the mode of appointment by the\n",
      "governor of New York, closeted in a secret apartment with at most\n",
      "four, and frequently with only two persons; and if we at the same time\n",
      "consider how much more easy it must be to influence the small number of\n",
      "which a council of appointment consists, than the considerable number of\n",
      "which the national Senate would consist, we cannot hesitate to pronounce\n",
      "that the power of the chief magistrate of this State, in the disposition\n",
      "of offices, must, in practice, be greatly superior to that of the Chief\n",
      "Magistrate of the Union.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence it appears that, except as to the concurrent authority of the\n",
      "President in the article of treaties, it would be difficult to determine\n",
      "whether that magistrate would, in the aggregate, possess more or\n",
      "less power than the Governor of New York. And it appears yet more\n",
      "unequivocally, that there is no pretense for the parallel which has been\n",
      "attempted between him and the king of Great Britain. But to render the\n",
      "contrast in this respect still more striking, it may be of use to throw\n",
      "the principal circumstances of dissimilitude into a closer group.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President of the United States would be an officer elected by the\n",
      "people for four years; the king of Great Britain is a perpetual and\n",
      "hereditary prince. The one would be amenable to personal punishment\n",
      "and disgrace; the person of the other is sacred and inviolable. The one\n",
      "would have a qualified negative upon the acts of the legislative body;\n",
      "the other has an absolute negative. The one would have a right to\n",
      "command the military and naval forces of the nation; the other, in\n",
      "addition to this right, possesses that of declaring war, and of raising\n",
      "and regulating fleets and armies by his own authority. The one would\n",
      "have a concurrent power with a branch of the legislature in the\n",
      "formation of treaties; the other is the sole possessor of the power\n",
      "of making treaties. The one would have a like concurrent authority in\n",
      "appointing to offices; the other is the sole author of all appointments.\n",
      "The one can confer no privileges whatever; the other can make denizens\n",
      "of aliens, noblemen of commoners; can erect corporations with all the\n",
      "rights incident to corporate bodies. The one can prescribe no rules\n",
      "concerning the commerce or currency of the nation; the other is in\n",
      "several respects the arbiter of commerce, and in this capacity can\n",
      "establish markets and fairs, can regulate weights and measures, can lay\n",
      "embargoes for a limited time, can coin money, can authorize or prohibit\n",
      "the circulation of foreign coin. The one has no particle of spiritual\n",
      "jurisdiction; the other is the supreme head and governor of the national\n",

      "THERE is an idea, which is not without its advocates, that a vigorous\n",
      "Executive is inconsistent with the genius of republican government. The\n",
      "enlightened well-wishers to this species of government must at least\n",
      "hope that the supposition is destitute of foundation; since they\n",
      "can never admit its truth, without at the same time admitting the\n",
      "condemnation of their own principles. Energy in the Executive is a\n",
      "leading character in the definition of good government. It is essential\n",
      "to the protection of the community against foreign attacks; it is\n",
      "not less essential to the steady administration of the laws; to\n",

      "combinations which sometimes interrupt the ordinary course of justice;\n",
      "to the security of liberty against the enterprises and assaults of\n",
      "ambition, of faction, and of anarchy. Every man the least conversant in\n",
      "Roman history, knows how often that republic was obliged to take refuge\n",
      "in the absolute power of a single man, under the formidable title of\n",
      "Dictator, as well against the intrigues of ambitious individuals who\n",
      "aspired to the tyranny, and the seditions of whole classes of the\n",
      "community whose conduct threatened the existence of all government, as\n",
      "against the invasions of external enemies who menaced the conquest and\n",
      "destruction of Rome.\n",

      "There can be no need, however, to multiply arguments or examples on this\n",

      "Taking it for granted, therefore, that all men of sense will agree in\n",
      "the necessity of an energetic Executive, it will only remain to inquire,\n",
      "what are the ingredients which constitute this energy? How far can they\n",

      "DURATION in office has been mentioned as the second requisite to the\n",
      "energy of the Executive authority. This has relation to two objects: to\n",
      "the personal firmness of the executive magistrate, in the employment\n",
      "of his constitutional powers; and to the stability of the system of\n",
      "administration which may have been adopted under his auspices. With\n",
      "regard to the first, it must be evident, that the longer the duration in\n",
      "office, the greater will be the probability of obtaining so important an\n",
      "advantage. It is a general principle of human nature, that a man will\n",

      "enjoys by a durable or certain title; and, of course, will be willing to\n",
      "risk more for the sake of the one, than for the sake of the other. This\n",
      "remark is not less applicable to a political privilege, or honor, or\n",
      "trust, than to any article of ordinary property. The inference from\n",
      "it is, that a man acting in the capacity of chief magistrate, under a\n",
      "consciousness that in a very short time he MUST lay down his office,\n",
      "will be apt to feel himself too little interested in it to hazard any\n",

      "itself, or even in a predominant faction in the legislative body. If the\n",
      "case should only be, that he MIGHT lay it down, unless continued by a\n",

      "conspiring with his fears, would tend still more powerfully to corrupt\n",

      "complaisance to every sudden breeze of passion, or to every transient\n",
      "impulse which the people may receive from the arts of men, who flatter\n",
      "their prejudices to betray their interests. It is a just observation,\n",

      "with, the last violates, the fundamental principles of good government;\n",
      "and, whatever may be the forms of the Constitution, unites all power\n",
      "in the same hands. The tendency of the legislative authority to absorb\n",
      "every other, has been fully displayed and illustrated by examples in\n",
      "some preceding numbers. In governments purely republican, this tendency\n",
      "is almost irresistible. The representatives of the people, in a popular\n",
      "assembly, seem sometimes to fancy that they are the people themselves,\n",
      "and betray strong symptoms of impatience and disgust at the least sign\n",
      "of opposition from any other quarter; as if the exercise of its rights,\n",
      "by either the executive or judiciary, were a breach of their privilege\n",
      "and an outrage to their dignity. They often appear disposed to exert an\n",
      "imperious control over the other departments; and as they commonly have\n",

      "a short-lived advantage, and the little inducement it affords him to\n",
      "expose himself, on account of it, to any considerable inconvenience\n",
      "or hazard. Another answer, perhaps more obvious, though not more\n",

      "would not, for that reason, be preferable to a longer period, which was,\n",

      "influence upon the spirit and character of the government. Between the\n",
      "commencement and termination of such a period, there would always be a\n",

      "he approached the moment when the public were, by a new election, to\n",

      "THE administration of government, in its largest sense, comprehends all\n",
      "the operations of the body politic, whether legislative, executive,\n",
      "or judiciary; but in its most usual, and perhaps its most precise\n",
      "signification. it is limited to executive details, and falls peculiarly\n",
      "within the province of the executive department. The actual conduct of\n",
      "foreign negotiations, the preparatory plans of finance, the application\n",
      "and disbursement of the public moneys in conformity to the general\n",
      "appropriations of the legislature, the arrangement of the army and navy,\n",
      "the directions of the operations of war--these, and other matters of a\n",
      "like nature, constitute what seems to be most properly understood by the\n",
      "administration of government. The persons, therefore, to whose immediate\n",
      "management these different matters are committed, ought to be considered\n",
      "as the assistants or deputies of the chief magistrate, and on this\n",
      "account, they ought to derive their offices from his appointment,\n",
      "at least from his nomination, and ought to be subject to his\n",
      "superintendence. This view of the subject will at once suggest to us the\n",
      "intimate connection between the duration of the executive magistrate in\n",
      "office and the stability of the system of administration. To reverse and\n",
      "undo what has been done by a predecessor, is very often considered by a\n",
      "successor as the best proof he can give of his own capacity and desert;\n",
      "and in addition to this propensity, where the alteration has been\n",

      "together could not fail to occasion a disgraceful and ruinous mutability\n",
      "in the administration of the government.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a positive duration of considerable extent, I connect the\n",
      "circumstance of re-eligibility. The first is necessary to give to the\n",
      "officer himself the inclination and the resolution to act his part well,\n",
      "and to the community time and leisure to observe the tendency of his\n",
      "measures, and thence to form an experimental estimate of their merits.\n",

      "Nothing appears more plausible at first sight, nor more ill-founded upon\n",

      "magistrate in office for a certain time, and then excluding him from it,\n",
      "either for a limited period or forever after. This exclusion, whether\n",
      "temporary or perpetual, would have nearly the same effects, and these\n",
      "effects would be for the most part rather pernicious than salutary.\n",

      "determinate period, than when they were permitted to entertain a hope of\n",
      "obtaining, by meriting, a continuance of them. This position will not be\n",

      "his appetite for them to his appetite for gain. But with the prospect\n",
      "before him of approaching an inevitable annihilation, his avarice\n",
      "would be likely to get the victory over his caution, his vanity, or his\n",
      "ambition.\n",
      "\n",
      "An ambitious man, too, when he found himself seated on the summit of his\n",
      "country's honors, when he looked forward to the time at which he must\n",
      "descend from the exalted eminence for ever, and reflected that no\n",
      "exertion of merit on his part could save him from the unwelcome reverse;\n",
      "such a man, in such a situation, would be much more violently tempted to\n",
      "embrace a favorable conjuncture for attempting the prolongation of\n",

      "people like discontented ghosts, and sighing for a place which they were\n",
      "destined never more to possess?\n",
      "\n",
      "A third ill effect of the exclusion would be, the depriving the\n",
      "community of the advantage of the experience gained by the chief\n",
      "magistrate in the exercise of his office. That experience is the parent\n",
      "of wisdom, is an adage the truth of which is recognized by the wisest as\n",
      "well as the simplest of mankind. What more desirable or more essential\n",
      "than this quality in the governors of nations? Where more desirable or\n",
      "more essential than in the first magistrate of a nation? Can it be\n",
      "wise to put this desirable and essential quality under the ban of\n",
      "the Constitution, and to declare that the moment it is acquired, its\n",
      "possessor shall be compelled to abandon the station in which it was\n",
      "acquired, and to which it is adapted? This, nevertheless, is the precise\n",
      "import of all those regulations which exclude men from serving their\n",
      "country, by the choice of their fellowcitizens, after they have by a\n",
      "course of service fitted themselves for doing it with a greater degree\n",
      "of utility.\n",
      "\n",
      "A fourth ill effect of the exclusion would be the banishing men from\n",
      "stations in which, in certain emergencies of the state, their presence\n",
      "might be of the greatest moment to the public interest or safety. There\n",
      "is no nation which has not, at one period or another, experienced an\n",
      "absolute necessity of the services of particular men in particular\n",
      "situations; perhaps it would not be too strong to say, to the\n",
      "preservation of its political existence. How unwise, therefore, must be\n",
      "every such self-denying ordinance as serves to prohibit a nation\n",
      "from making use of its own citizens in the manner best suited to\n",
      "its exigencies and circumstances! Without supposing the personal\n",
      "essentiality of the man, it is evident that a change of the chief\n",
      "magistrate, at the breaking out of a war, or at any similar crisis, for\n",
      "another, even of equal merit, would at all times be detrimental to the\n",
      "community, inasmuch as it would substitute inexperience to experience,\n",
      "and would tend to unhinge and set afloat the already settled train of\n",
      "the administration.\n",
      "\n",
      "A fifth ill effect of the exclusion would be, that it would operate as\n",
      "a constitutional interdiction of stability in the administration. By\n",
      "necessitating a change of men, in the first office of the nation, it\n",
      "would necessitate a mutability of measures. It is not generally to be\n",
      "expected, that men will vary and measures remain uniform. The contrary\n",
      "is the usual course of things. And we need not be apprehensive that\n",
      "there will be too much stability, while there is even the option of\n",
      "changing; nor need we desire to prohibit the people from continuing\n",
      "their confidence where they think it may be safely placed, and where,\n",
      "by constancy on their part, they may obviate the fatal inconveniences of\n",
      "fluctuating councils and a variable policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "These are some of the disadvantages which would flow from the principle\n",
      "of exclusion. They apply most forcibly to the scheme of a perpetual\n",
      "exclusion; but when we consider that even a partial exclusion would\n",
      "always render the readmission of the person a remote and precarious\n",
      "object, the observations which have been made will apply nearly as fully\n",
      "to one case as to the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the advantages promised to counterbalance these disadvantages?\n",
      "They are represented to be: 1st, greater independence in the magistrate;\n",
      "2d, greater security to the people. Unless the exclusion be perpetual,\n",
      "there will be no pretense to infer the first advantage. But even in that\n",
      "case, may he have no object beyond his present station, to which he may\n",
      "sacrifice his independence? May he have no connections, no friends, for\n",
      "whom he may sacrifice it? May he not be less willing by a firm conduct,\n",
      "to make personal enemies, when he acts under the impression that a time\n",
      "is fast approaching, on the arrival of which he not only MAY, but\n",
      "MUST, be exposed to their resentments, upon an equal, perhaps upon an\n",
      "inferior, footing? It is not an easy point to determine whether his\n",
      "independence would be most promoted or impaired by such an arrangement.\n",
      "\n",
      "As to the second supposed advantage, there is still greater reason to\n",
      "entertain doubts concerning it. If the exclusion were to be perpetual,\n",
      "a man of irregular ambition, of whom alone there could be reason in any\n",
      "case to entertain apprehension, would, with infinite reluctance, yield\n",
      "to the necessity of taking his leave forever of a post in which his\n",
      "passion for power and pre-eminence had acquired the force of habit. And\n",
      "if he had been fortunate or adroit enough to conciliate the good-will\n",
      "of the people, he might induce them to consider as a very odious\n",
      "and unjustifiable restraint upon themselves, a provision which was\n",
      "calculated to debar them of the right of giving a fresh proof of their\n",
      "attachment to a favorite. There may be conceived circumstances in which\n",
      "this disgust of the people, seconding the thwarted ambition of such\n",
      "a favorite, might occasion greater danger to liberty, than could ever\n",
      "reasonably be dreaded from the possibility of a perpetuation in office,\n",
      "by the voluntary suffrages of the community, exercising a constitutional\n",
      "privilege.\n",

      "to defend himself against the depredations of the latter. He might\n",
      "gradually be stripped of his authorities by successive resolutions,\n",
      "or annihilated by a single vote. And in the one mode or the other, the\n",
      "legislative and executive powers might speedily come to be blended in\n",
      "the same hands. If even no propensity had ever discovered itself in the\n",
      "legislative body to invade the rights of the Executive, the rules of\n",
      "just reasoning and theoretic propriety would of themselves teach us,\n",
      "that the one ought not to be left to the mercy of the other, but ought\n",
      "to possess a constitutional and effectual power of self-defense.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the power in question has a further use. It not only serves as a\n",
      "shield to the Executive, but it furnishes an additional security against\n",
      "the enaction of improper laws. It establishes a salutary check upon the\n",
      "legislative body, calculated to guard the community against the effects\n",
      "of faction, precipitancy, or of any impulse unfriendly to the public\n",
      "good, which may happen to influence a majority of that body.\n",
      "\n",
      "The propriety of a negative has, upon some occasions, been combated\n",
      "by an observation, that it was not to be presumed a single man would\n",
      "possess more virtue and wisdom than a number of men; and that unless\n",
      "this presumption should be entertained, it would be improper to give the\n",
      "executive magistrate any species of control over the legislative body.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this observation, when examined, will appear rather specious than\n",
      "solid. The propriety of the thing does not turn upon the supposition\n",
      "of superior wisdom or virtue in the Executive, but upon the supposition\n",
      "that the legislature will not be infallible; that the love of power may\n",
      "sometimes betray it into a disposition to encroach upon the rights of\n",
      "other members of the government; that a spirit of faction may sometimes\n",
      "pervert its deliberations; that impressions of the moment may sometimes\n",
      "hurry it into measures which itself, on maturer reflexion, would\n",
      "condemn. The primary inducement to conferring the power in question upon\n",
      "the Executive is, to enable him to defend himself; the secondary one is\n",
      "to increase the chances in favor of the community against the passing\n",
      "of bad laws, through haste, inadvertence, or design. The oftener the\n",
      "measure is brought under examination, the greater the diversity in the\n",
      "situations of those who are to examine it, the less must be the danger\n",
      "of those errors which flow from want of due deliberation, or of those\n",
      "missteps which proceed from the contagion of some common passion or\n",
      "interest. It is far less probable, that culpable views of any kind\n",
      "should infect all the parts of the government at the same moment and in\n",
      "relation to the same object, than that they should by turns govern and\n",
      "mislead every one of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "It may perhaps be said that the power of preventing bad laws includes\n",
      "that of preventing good ones; and may be used to the one purpose as well\n",
      "as to the other. But this objection will have little weight with\n",
      "those who can properly estimate the mischiefs of that inconstancy and\n",
      "mutability in the laws, which form the greatest blemish in the character\n",
      "and genius of our governments. They will consider every institution\n",
      "calculated to restrain the excess of law-making, and to keep things in\n",
      "the same state in which they happen to be at any given period, as much\n",
      "more likely to do good than harm; because it is favorable to greater\n",
      "stability in the system of legislation. The injury which may possibly\n",
      "be done by defeating a few good laws, will be amply compensated by the\n",
      "advantage of preventing a number of bad ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor is this all. The superior weight and influence of the legislative\n",
      "body in a free government, and the hazard to the Executive in a trial\n",
      "of strength with that body, afford a satisfactory security that the\n",
      "negative would generally be employed with great caution; and there\n",
      "would oftener be room for a charge of timidity than of rashness in the\n",
      "exercise of it. A king of Great Britain, with all his train of sovereign\n",
      "attributes, and with all the influence he draws from a thousand\n",
      "sources, would, at this day, hesitate to put a negative upon the joint\n",
      "resolutions of the two houses of Parliament. He would not fail to\n",
      "exert the utmost resources of that influence to strangle a measure\n",
      "disagreeable to him, in its progress to the throne, to avoid being\n",
      "reduced to the dilemma of permitting it to take effect, or of risking\n",
      "the displeasure of the nation by an opposition to the sense of the\n",
      "legislative body. Nor is it probable, that he would ultimately venture\n",
      "to exert his prerogatives, but in a case of manifest propriety, or\n",
      "extreme necessity. All well-informed men in that kingdom will accede\n",
      "to the justness of this remark. A very considerable period has elapsed\n",
      "since the negative of the crown has been exercised.\n",

      "If a magistrate so powerful and so well fortified as a British monarch,\n",
      "would have scruples about the exercise of the power under consideration,\n",
      "how much greater caution may be reasonably expected in a President of\n",

      "\n",
      "It is evident that there would be greater danger of his not using his\n",
      "power when necessary, than of his using it too often, or too much. An\n",
      "argument, indeed, against its expediency, has been drawn from this very\n",
      "source. It has been represented, on this account, as a power odious in\n",
      "appearance, useless in practice. But it will not follow, that because it\n",
      "might be rarely exercised, it would never be exercised. In the case\n",
      "for which it is chiefly designed, that of an immediate attack upon the\n",
      "constitutional rights of the Executive, or in a case in which the public\n",
      "good was evidently and palpably sacrificed, a man of tolerable firmness\n",
      "would avail himself of his constitutional means of defense, and would\n",
      "listen to the admonitions of duty and responsibility. In the former\n",
      "supposition, his fortitude would be stimulated by his immediate interest\n",
      "in the power of his office; in the latter, by the probability of the\n",
      "sanction of his constituents, who, though they would naturally incline\n",
      "to the legislative body in a doubtful case, would hardly suffer their\n",
      "partiality to delude them in a very plain case. I speak now with an eye\n",
      "to a magistrate possessing only a common share of firmness. There are\n",

      "a considerable part of the legislative body. Instead of an absolute\n",
      "negative, it is proposed to give the Executive the qualified negative\n",
      "already described. This is a power which would be much more readily\n",
      "exercised than the other. A man who might be afraid to defeat a law by\n",
      "his single VETO, might not scruple to return it for reconsideration;\n",
      "subject to being finally rejected only in the event of more than one\n",
      "third of each house concurring in the sufficiency of his objections.\n",
      "He would be encouraged by the reflection, that if his opposition should\n",

      "legislative body, whose influence would be united with his in supporting\n",
      "the propriety of his conduct in the public opinion. A direct and\n",
      "categorical negative has something in the appearance of it more harsh,\n",
      "and more apt to irritate, than the mere suggestion of argumentative\n",
      "objections to be approved or disapproved by those to whom they are\n",
      "addressed. In proportion as it would be less apt to offend, it would be\n",
      "more apt to be exercised; and for this very reason, it may in practice\n",
      "be found more effectual. It is to be hoped that it will not often happen\n",
      "that improper views will govern so large a proportion as two thirds of\n",
      "both branches of the legislature at the same time; and this, too, in\n",
      "spite of the counterposing weight of the Executive. It is at any rate\n",
      "far less probable that this should be the case, than that such views\n",
      "should taint the resolutions and conduct of a bare majority. A power of\n",

      "though forcible, operation. When men, engaged in unjustifiable pursuits,\n",
      "are aware that obstructions may come from a quarter which they cannot\n",

      "same time, so consonant to the precedents of the State constitutions in\n",
      "general, that little need be said to explain or enforce it. Even those\n",
      "of them which have, in other respects, coupled the chief magistrate with\n",
      "a council, have for the most part concentrated the military authority in\n",

      "the direction of the common strength; and the power of directing and\n",
      "employing the common strength, forms a usual and essential part in the\n",

      "\"The President may require the opinion, in writing, of the principal\n",

      "criminal code of every country partakes so much of necessary severity,\n",
      "that without an easy access to exceptions in favor of unfortunate guilt,\n",
      "justice would wear a countenance too sanguinary and cruel. As the sense\n",
      "of responsibility is always strongest, in proportion as it is undivided,\n",
      "it may be inferred that a single man would be most ready to attend to\n",
      "the force of those motives which might plead for a mitigation of the\n",
      "rigor of the law, and least apt to yield to considerations which were\n",
      "calculated to shelter a fit object of its vengeance. The reflection that\n",
      "the fate of a fellow-creature depended on his sole fiat, would naturally\n",
      "inspire scrupulousness and caution; the dread of being accused of\n",
      "weakness or connivance, would beget equal circumspection, though of a\n",
      "different kind. On the other hand, as men generally derive confidence\n",
      "from their numbers, they might often encourage each other in an act of\n",
      "obduracy, and might be less sensible to the apprehension of suspicion or\n",
      "censure for an injudicious or affected clemency. On these accounts, one\n",
      "man appears to be a more eligible dispenser of the mercy of government,\n",
      "than a body of men.\n",
      "\n",
      "The expediency of vesting the power of pardoning in the President\n",
      "has, if I mistake not, been only contested in relation to the crime of\n",
      "treason. This, it has been urged, ought to have depended upon the assent\n",
      "of one, or both, of the branches of the legislative body. I shall not\n",
      "deny that there are strong reasons to be assigned for requiring in this\n",
      "particular the concurrence of that body, or of a part of it. As treason\n",
      "is a crime levelled at the immediate being of the society, when the laws\n",
      "have once ascertained the guilt of the offender, there seems a fitness\n",
      "in referring the expediency of an act of mercy towards him to the\n",
      "judgment of the legislature. And this ought the rather to be the case,\n",
      "as the supposition of the connivance of the Chief Magistrate ought not\n",
      "to be entirely excluded. But there are also strong objections to such\n",
      "a plan. It is not to be doubted, that a single man of prudence and good\n",
      "sense is better fitted, in delicate conjunctures, to balance the motives\n",
      "which may plead for and against the remission of the punishment, than\n",
      "any numerous body whatever. It deserves particular attention, that\n",
      "treason will often be connected with seditions which embrace a large\n",
      "proportion of the community; as lately happened in Massachusetts. In\n",
      "every such case, we might expect to see the representation of the people\n",
      "tainted with the same spirit which had given birth to the offense. And\n",
      "when parties were pretty equally matched, the secret sympathy of the\n",
      "friends and favorers of the condemned person, availing itself of the\n",
      "good-nature and weakness of others, might frequently bestow impunity\n",
      "where the terror of an example was necessary. On the other hand,\n",
      "when the sedition had proceeded from causes which had inflamed the\n",
      "resentments of the major party, they might often be found obstinate and\n",
      "inexorable, when policy demanded a conduct of forbearance and clemency.\n",
      "But the principal argument for reposing the power of pardoning in this\n",
      "case to the Chief Magistrate is this: in seasons of insurrection or\n",
      "rebellion, there are often critical moments, when a well-timed offer of\n",
      "pardon to the insurgents or rebels may restore the tranquillity of the\n",
      "commonwealth; and which, if suffered to pass unimproved, it may never\n",
      "be possible afterwards to recall. The dilatory process of convening the\n",
      "legislature, or one of its branches, for the purpose of obtaining its\n",
      "sanction to the measure, would frequently be the occasion of letting\n",
      "slip the golden opportunity. The loss of a week, a day, an hour, may\n",
      "sometimes be fatal. If it should be observed, that a discretionary\n",
      "power, with a view to such contingencies, might be occasionally\n",
      "conferred upon the President, it may be answered in the first place,\n",
      "that it is questionable, whether, in a limited Constitution, that\n",
      "power could be delegated by law; and in the second place, that it would\n",
      "generally be impolitic beforehand to take any step which might hold out\n",
      "the prospect of impunity. A proceeding of this kind, out of the usual\n",
      "course, would be likely to be construed into an argument of timidity or\n",

      "grounds, with no small degree of vehemence, I scruple not to declare\n",
      "my firm persuasion, that it is one of the best digested and most\n",
      "unexceptionable parts of the plan. One ground of objection is the trite\n",
      "topic of the intermixture of powers; some contending that the President\n",
      "ought alone to possess the power of making treaties; others, that it\n",
      "ought to have been exclusively deposited in the Senate. Another source\n",

      "opinion that the House of Representatives ought to have been associated\n",

      "necessary than to have substituted two thirds of all the members of the\n",
      "Senate, to two thirds of the members present. As I flatter myself the\n",

      "granted, as an inference from them, that the union of the Executive with\n",
      "the Senate, in the article of treaties, is no infringement of that rule.\n",
      "I venture to add, that the particular nature of the power of making\n",
      "treaties indicates a peculiar propriety in that union. Though several\n",
      "writers on the subject of government place that power in the class of\n",
      "executive authorities, yet this is evidently an arbitrary disposition;\n",
      "for if we attend carefully to its operation, it will be found to partake\n",
      "more of the legislative than of the executive character, though it does\n",
      "not seem strictly to fall within the definition of either of them. The\n",
      "essence of the legislative authority is to enact laws, or, in other\n",
      "words, to prescribe rules for the regulation of the society; while the\n",
      "execution of the laws, and the employment of the common strength, either\n",
      "for this purpose or for the common defense, seem to comprise all the\n",
      "functions of the executive magistrate. The power of making treaties\n",
      "is, plainly, neither the one nor the other. It relates neither to the\n",
      "execution of the subsisting laws, nor to the enaction of new ones;\n",
      "and still less to an exertion of the common strength. Its objects are\n",
      "CONTRACTS with foreign nations, which have the force of law, but derive\n",
      "it from the obligations of good faith. They are not rules prescribed\n",
      "by the sovereign to the subject, but agreements between sovereign and\n",
      "sovereign. The power in question seems therefore to form a distinct\n",
      "department, and to belong, properly, neither to the legislative nor to\n",
      "the executive. The qualities elsewhere detailed as indispensable in the\n",
      "management of foreign negotiations, point out the Executive as the most\n",
      "fit agent in those transactions; while the vast importance of the\n",

      "that power to an elective magistrate of four years' duration. It has\n",
      "been remarked, upon another occasion, and the remark is unquestionably\n",
      "just, that an hereditary monarch, though often the oppressor of his\n",
      "people, has personally too much stake in the government to be in any\n",

      "of the President in the conduct of foreign negotiations. It is true that\n",
      "the Senate would, in that case, have the option of employing him in this\n",
      "capacity, but they would also have the option of letting it alone, and\n",
      "pique or cabal might induce the latter rather than the former. Besides\n",

      "important a trust, yet it cannot be doubted that his participation would\n",
      "materially add to the safety of the society. It must indeed be clear to\n",
      "a demonstration that the joint possession of the power in question, by\n",
      "the President and Senate, would afford a greater prospect of security,\n",
      "than the separate possession of it by either of them. And whoever has\n",
      "maturely weighed the circumstances which must concur in the appointment\n",

      "wisdom, as on that of integrity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The remarks made in a former number, which have been alluded to in\n",
      "another part of this paper, will apply with conclusive force against the\n",
      "admission of the House of Representatives to a share in the formation\n",
      "of treaties. The fluctuating and, taking its future increase into the\n",
      "account, the multitudinous composition of that body, forbid us to expect\n",
      "in it those qualities which are essential to the proper execution of\n",
      "such a trust. Accurate and comprehensive knowledge of foreign politics;\n",
      "a steady and systematic adherence to the same views; a nice and uniform\n",
      "sensibility to national character; decision, secrecy, and despatch, are\n",
      "incompatible with the genius of a body so variable and so numerous. The\n",
      "very complication of the business, by introducing a necessity of the\n",
      "concurrence of so many different bodies, would of itself afford a\n",
      "solid objection. The greater frequency of the calls upon the House of\n",
      "Representatives, and the greater length of time which it would often be\n",
      "necessary to keep them together when convened, to obtain their sanction\n",
      "in the progressive stages of a treaty, would be a source of so great\n",
      "inconvenience and expense as alone ought to condemn the project.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only objection which remains to be canvassed, is that which would\n",
      "substitute the proportion of two thirds of all the members composing the\n",
      "senatorial body, to that of two thirds of the members present. It has\n",
      "been shown, under the second head of our inquiries, that all provisions\n",
      "which require more than the majority of any body to its resolutions,\n",
      "have a direct tendency to embarrass the operations of the government,\n",
      "and an indirect one to subject the sense of the majority to that of the\n",
      "minority. This consideration seems sufficient to determine our opinion,\n",
      "that the convention have gone as far in the endeavor to secure the\n",
      "advantage of numbers in the formation of treaties as could have been\n",
      "reconciled either with the activity of the public councils or with a\n",
      "reasonable regard to the major sense of the community. If two thirds of\n",
      "the whole number of members had been required, it would, in many cases,\n",
      "from the non-attendance of a part, amount in practice to a necessity\n",
      "of unanimity. And the history of every political establishment in which\n",
      "this principle has prevailed, is a history of impotence, perplexity, and\n",
      "disorder. Proofs of this position might be adduced from the examples of\n",
      "the Roman Tribuneship, the Polish Diet, and the States-General of\n",
      "the Netherlands, did not an example at home render foreign precedents\n",
      "unnecessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "To require a fixed proportion of the whole body would not, in all\n",
      "probability, contribute to the advantages of a numerous agency, better\n",
      "then merely to require a proportion of the attending members. The\n",
      "former, by making a determinate number at all times requisite to a\n",
      "resolution, diminishes the motives to punctual attendance. The latter,\n",
      "by making the capacity of the body to depend on a proportion which\n",
      "may be varied by the absence or presence of a single member, has the\n",
      "contrary effect. And as, by promoting punctuality, it tends to keep\n",
      "the body complete, there is great likelihood that its resolutions would\n",
      "generally be dictated by as great a number in this case as in the other;\n",
      "while there would be much fewer occasions of delay. It ought not to be\n",
      "forgotten that, under the existing Confederation, two members may, and\n",
      "usually do, represent a State; whence it happens that Congress, who now\n",
      "are solely invested with all the powers of the Union, rarely consist of\n",
      "a greater number of persons than would compose the intended Senate. If\n",
      "we add to this, that as the members vote by States, and that where there\n",
      "is only a single member present from a State, his vote is lost, it will\n",
      "justify a supposition that the active voices in the Senate, where the\n",
      "members are to vote individually, would rarely fall short in number of\n",
      "the active voices in the existing Congress. When, in addition to these\n",
      "considerations, we take into view the co-operation of the President,\n",
      "we shall not hesitate to infer that the people of America would\n",
      "have greater security against an improper use of the power of making\n",

      "administration.\" If the justness of this observation be admitted, the\n",
      "mode of appointing the officers of the United States contained in the\n",

      "the position, that there would always be great probability of having the\n",
      "place supplied by a man of abilities, at least respectable. Premising\n",
      "this, I proceed to lay it down as a rule, that one man of discernment is\n",

      "The sole and undivided responsibility of one man will naturally beget a\n",
      "livelier sense of duty and a more exact regard to reputation. He will,\n",
      "on this account, feel himself under stronger obligations, and more\n",
      "interested to investigate with care the qualities requisite to the\n",
      "stations to be filled, and to prefer with impartiality the persons who\n",
      "may have the fairest pretensions to them. He will have fewer personal\n",

      "have an equal number; and will be so much the less liable to be misled\n",
      "by the sentiments of friendship and of affection. A single well-directed\n",
      "man, by a single understanding, cannot be distracted and warped by that\n",
      "diversity of views, feelings, and interests, which frequently distract\n",
      "and warp the resolutions of a collective body. There is nothing so apt\n",
      "to agitate the passions of mankind as personal considerations whether\n",
      "they relate to ourselves or to others, who are to be the objects of\n",
      "our choice or preference. Hence, in every exercise of the power of\n",
      "appointing to offices, by an assembly of men, we must expect to see\n",
      "a full display of all the private and party likings and dislikes,\n",
      "partialities and antipathies, attachments and animosities, which are\n",
      "felt by those who compose the assembly. The choice which may at any time\n",
      "happen to be made under such circumstances, will of course be the\n",
      "result either of a victory gained by one party over the other, or of a\n",
      "compromise between the parties. In either case, the intrinsic merit\n",
      "of the candidate will be too often out of sight. In the first, the\n",
      "qualifications best adapted to uniting the suffrages of the party, will\n",
      "be more considered than those which fit the person for the station.\n",
      "In the last, the coalition will commonly turn upon some interested\n",
      "equivalent: \"Give us the man we wish for this office, and you shall\n",

      "The truth of the principles here advanced seems to have been felt by the\n",
      "most intelligent of those who have found fault with the provision made,\n",
      "in this respect, by the convention. They contend that the President\n",
      "ought solely to have been authorized to make the appointments under the\n",
      "federal government. But it is easy to show, that every advantage to be\n",
      "expected from such an arrangement would, in substance, be derived from\n",
      "the power of nomination, which is proposed to be conferred upon him;\n",
      "while several disadvantages which might attend the absolute power of\n",
      "appointment in the hands of that officer would be avoided. In the act\n",
      "of nomination, his judgment alone would be exercised; and as it would\n",
      "be his sole duty to point out the man who, with the approbation of the\n",
      "Senate, should fill an office, his responsibility would be as complete\n",
      "as if he were to make the final appointment. There can, in this view, be\n",
      "no difference between nominating and appointing. The same motives which\n",
      "would influence a proper discharge of his duty in one case, would exist\n",
      "in the other. And as no man could be appointed but on his previous\n",
      "nomination, every man who might be appointed would be, in fact, his\n",
      "choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "But might not his nomination be overruled? I grant it might, yet this\n",
      "could only be to make place for another nomination by himself. The\n",
      "person ultimately appointed must be the object of his preference, though\n",
      "perhaps not in the first degree. It is also not very probable that his\n",
      "nomination would often be overruled. The Senate could not be tempted, by\n",
      "the preference they might feel to another, to reject the one proposed;\n",
      "because they could not assure themselves, that the person they\n",
      "might wish would be brought forward by a second or by any subsequent\n",
      "nomination. They could not even be certain, that a future nomination\n",
      "would present a candidate in any degree more acceptable to them; and as\n",
      "their dissent might cast a kind of stigma upon the individual rejected,\n",
      "and might have the appearance of a reflection upon the judgment of the\n",
      "chief magistrate, it is not likely that their sanction would often\n",
      "be refused, where there were not special and strong reasons for the\n",
      "refusal.\n",
      "\n",
      "To what purpose then require the co-operation of the Senate? I answer,\n",
      "that the necessity of their concurrence would have a powerful, though,\n",
      "in general, a silent operation. It would be an excellent check upon a\n",
      "spirit of favoritism in the President, and would tend greatly to prevent\n",
      "the appointment of unfit characters from State prejudice, from family\n",
      "connection, from personal attachment, or from a view to popularity. In\n",
      "addition to this, it would be an efficacious source of stability in the\n",
      "administration.\n",
      "\n",
      "It will readily be comprehended, that a man who had himself the sole\n",
      "disposition of offices, would be governed much more by his private\n",
      "inclinations and interests, than when he was bound to submit the\n",
      "propriety of his choice to the discussion and determination of a\n",
      "different and independent body, and that body an entire branch of the\n",
      "legislature. The possibility of rejection would be a strong motive to\n",
      "care in proposing. The danger to his own reputation, and, in the case\n",
      "of an elective magistrate, to his political existence, from betraying\n",
      "a spirit of favoritism, or an unbecoming pursuit of popularity, to the\n",
      "observation of a body whose opinion would have great weight in forming\n",
      "that of the public, could not fail to operate as a barrier to the one\n",
      "and to the other. He would be both ashamed and afraid to bring forward,\n",
      "for the most distinguished or lucrative stations, candidates who had\n",
      "no other merit than that of coming from the same State to which he\n",
      "particularly belonged, or of being in some way or other personally\n",
      "allied to him, or of possessing the necessary insignificance and pliancy\n",
      "to render them the obsequious instruments of his pleasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "To this reasoning it has been objected that the President, by the\n",
      "influence of the power of nomination, may secure the complaisance of\n",
      "the Senate to his views. This supposition of universal venalty in\n",
      "human nature is little less an error in political reasoning, than the\n",
      "supposition of universal rectitude. The institution of delegated power\n",
      "implies, that there is a portion of virtue and honor among mankind,\n",
      "which may be a reasonable foundation of confidence; and experience\n",
      "justifies the theory. It has been found to exist in the most corrupt\n",
      "periods of the most corrupt governments. The venalty of the British\n",
      "House of Commons has been long a topic of accusation against that body,\n",
      "in the country to which they belong as well as in this; and it cannot be\n",
      "doubted that the charge is, to a considerable extent, well founded. But\n",
      "it is as little to be doubted, that there is always a large proportion\n",
      "of the body, which consists of independent and public-spirited men, who\n",
      "have an influential weight in the councils of the nation. Hence it is\n",
      "(the present reign not excepted) that the sense of that body is often\n",
      "seen to control the inclinations of the monarch, both with regard to men\n",
      "and to measures. Though it might therefore be allowable to suppose\n",
      "that the Executive might occasionally influence some individuals in\n",
      "the Senate, yet the supposition, that he could in general purchase\n",
      "the integrity of the whole body, would be forced and improbable. A man\n",
      "disposed to view human nature as it is, without either flattering\n",
      "its virtues or exaggerating its vices, will see sufficient ground of\n",
      "confidence in the probity of the Senate, to rest satisfied, not only\n",
      "that it will be impracticable to the Executive to corrupt or seduce a\n",
      "majority of its members, but that the necessity of its co-operation,\n",
      "in the business of appointments, will be a considerable and salutary\n",
      "restraint upon the conduct of that magistrate. Nor is the integrity\n",

      "that the instances in which the President could be personally interested\n",

      "the judgment of an entire branch of the legislature, the circumstances\n",
      "attending an appointment, from the mode of conducting it, would\n",
      "naturally become matters of notoriety; and the public would be at no\n",
      "loss to determine what part had been performed by the different actors.\n",
      "The blame of a bad nomination would fall upon the President singly and\n",
      "absolutely. The censure of rejecting a good one would lie entirely at\n",
      "the door of the Senate; aggravated by the consideration of their having\n",
      "counteracted the good intentions of the Executive. If an ill appointment\n",
      "should be made, the Executive for nominating, and the Senate for\n",
      "approving, would participate, though in different degrees, in the\n",
      "opprobrium and disgrace.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reverse of all this characterizes the manner of appointment in\n",
      "this State. The council of appointment consists of from three to five\n",
      "persons, of whom the governor is always one. This small body, shut up\n",
      "in a private apartment, impenetrable to the public eye, proceed to the\n",
      "execution of the trust committed to them. It is known that the governor\n",
      "claims the right of nomination, upon the strength of some ambiguous\n",
      "expressions in the constitution; but it is not known to what extent,\n",
      "or in what manner he exercises it; nor upon what occasions he is\n",
      "contradicted or opposed. The censure of a bad appointment, on account of\n",
      "the uncertainty of its author, and for want of a determinate object, has\n",
      "neither poignancy nor duration. And while an unbounded field for cabal\n",
      "and intrigue lies open, all idea of responsibility is lost. The most\n",
      "that the public can know, is that the governor claims the right of\n",
      "nomination; that two out of the inconsiderable number of four men\n",
      "can too often be managed without much difficulty; that if some of the\n",
      "members of a particular council should happen to be of an uncomplying\n",
      "character, it is frequently not impossible to get rid of their\n",
      "opposition by regulating the times of meeting in such a manner as to\n",
      "render their attendance inconvenient; and that from whatever cause it\n",
      "may proceed, a great number of very improper appointments are from time\n",
      "to time made. Whether a governor of this State avails himself of the\n",
      "ascendant he must necessarily have, in this delicate and important part\n",
      "of the administration, to prefer to offices men who are best qualified\n",
      "for them, or whether he prostitutes that advantage to the advancement of\n",
      "persons whose chief merit is their implicit devotion to his will, and to\n",
      "the support of a despicable and dangerous system of personal influence,\n",
      "are questions which, unfortunately for the community, can only be the\n",
      "subjects of speculation and conjecture.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every mere council of appointment, however constituted, will be a\n",
      "conclave, in which cabal and intrigue will have their full scope. Their\n",
      "number, without an unwarrantable increase of expense, cannot be large\n",
      "enough to preclude a facility of combination. And as each member will\n",
      "have his friends and connections to provide for, the desire of mutual\n",
      "gratification will beget a scandalous bartering of votes and bargaining\n",
      "for places. The private attachments of one man might easily be\n",
      "satisfied; but to satisfy the private attachments of a dozen, or of\n",
      "twenty men, would occasion a monopoly of all the principal employments\n",
      "of the government in a few families, and would lead more directly to an\n",
      "aristocracy or an oligarchy than any measure that could be contrived.\n",
      "If, to avoid an accumulation of offices, there was to be a frequent\n",
      "change in the persons who were to compose the council, this would\n",
      "involve the mischiefs of a mutable administration in their full extent.\n",
      "Such a council would also be more liable to executive influence than\n",
      "the Senate, because they would be fewer in number, and would act less\n",
      "immediately under the public inspection. Such a council, in fine, as\n",
      "a substitute for the plan of the convention, would be productive of an\n",
      "increase of expense, a multiplication of the evils which spring from\n",
      "favoritism and intrigue in the distribution of public honors, a decrease\n",
      "of stability in the administration of the government, and a diminution\n",
      "of the security against an undue influence of the Executive. And yet\n",
      "such a council has been warmly contended for as an essential amendment\n",
      "in the proposed Constitution.\n",

      "I could not with propriety conclude my observations on the subject of\n",
      "appointments without taking notice of a scheme for which there have\n",

      "House of Representatives in the power of making them. I shall, however,\n",
      "do little more than mention it, as I cannot imagine that it is likely to\n",
      "gain the countenance of any considerable part of the community. A body\n",
      "so fluctuating and at the same time so numerous, can never be deemed\n",
      "proper for the exercise of that power. Its unfitness will appear\n",
      "manifest to all, when it is recollected that in half a century it may\n",
      "consist of three or four hundred persons. All the advantages of the\n",
      "stability, both of the Executive and of the Senate, would be defeated by\n",
      "this union, and infinite delays and embarrassments would be occasioned.\n",
      "The example of most of the States in their local constitutions\n",
      "encourages us to reprobate the idea.\n",

      "The only remaining powers of the Executive are comprehended in giving\n",
      "information to Congress of the state of the Union; in recommending\n",
      "to their consideration such measures as he shall judge expedient; in\n",
      "convening them, or either branch, upon extraordinary occasions; in\n",
      "adjourning them when they cannot themselves agree upon the time of\n",

      "Except some cavils about the power of convening either house of the\n",
      "legislature, and that of receiving ambassadors, no objection has been\n",
      "made to this class of authorities; nor could they possibly admit of\n",
      "any. It required, indeed, an insatiable avidity for censure to invent\n",
      "exceptions to the parts which have been excepted to. In regard to the\n",
      "power of convening either house of the legislature, I shall barely\n",
      "remark, that in respect to the Senate at least, we can readily discover\n",
      "a good reason for it. AS this body has a concurrent power with the\n",
      "Executive in the article of treaties, it might often be necessary\n",
      "to call it together with a view to this object, when it would be\n",
      "unnecessary and improper to convene the House of Representatives. As to\n",
      "the reception of ambassadors, what I have said in a former paper will\n",
      "furnish a sufficient answer.\n",

      "We have now completed a survey of the structure and powers of the\n",
      "executive department, which, I have endeavored to show, combines, as far\n",
      "as republican principles will admit, all the requisites to energy. The\n",
      "remaining inquiry is: Does it also combine the requisites to safety,\n",
      "in a republican sense--a due dependence on the people, a due\n",
      "responsibility? The answer to this question has been anticipated in\n",
      "the investigation of its other characteristics, and is satisfactorily\n",
      "deducible from these circumstances; from the election of the President\n",
      "once in four years by persons immediately chosen by the people for that\n",
      "purpose; and from his being at all times liable to impeachment, trial,\n",
      "dismission from office, incapacity to serve in any other, and to\n",
      "forfeiture of life and estate by subsequent prosecution in the common\n",
      "course of law. But these precautions, great as they are, are not the\n",
      "only ones which the plan of the convention has provided in favor of\n",
      "the public security. In the only instances in which the abuse of the\n",
      "executive authority was materially to be feared, the Chief Magistrate of\n",

      "\n",
      "To the People of the State of New York:\n",
      "\n",
      "WE PROCEED now to an examination of the judiciary department of the\n",
      "proposed government.\n",
      "\n",
      "In unfolding the defects of the existing Confederation, the utility and\n",
      "necessity of a federal judicature have been clearly pointed out. It is\n",
      "the less necessary to recapitulate the considerations there urged, as\n",
      "the propriety of the institution in the abstract is not disputed; the\n",
      "only questions which have been raised being relative to the manner of\n",
      "constituting it, and to its extent. To these points, therefore, our\n",
      "observations shall be confined.\n",
      "\n",
      "The manner of constituting it seems to embrace these several objects:\n",
      "1st. The mode of appointing the judges. 2d. The tenure by which they\n",
      "are to hold their places. 3d. The partition of the judiciary authority\n",
      "between different courts, and their relations to each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "First. As to the mode of appointing the judges; this is the same with\n",
      "that of appointing the officers of the Union in general, and has been so\n",
      "fully discussed in the two last numbers, that nothing can be said here\n",
      "which would not be useless repetition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second. As to the tenure by which the judges are to hold their places;\n",
      "this chiefly concerns their duration in office; the provisions for their\n",
      "support; the precautions for their responsibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the plan of the convention, all judges who may be appointed\n",
      "by the United States are to hold their offices during good behavior;\n",
      "which is conformable to the most approved of the State constitutions and\n",
      "among the rest, to that of this State. Its propriety having been drawn\n",
      "into question by the adversaries of that plan, is no light symptom\n",
      "of the rage for objection, which disorders their imaginations and\n",
      "judgments. The standard of good behavior for the continuance in office\n",
      "of the judicial magistracy, is certainly one of the most valuable of the\n",
      "modern improvements in the practice of government. In a monarchy it is\n",
      "an excellent barrier to the despotism of the prince; in a republic it is\n",
      "a no less excellent barrier to the encroachments and oppressions of the\n",
      "representative body. And it is the best expedient which can be\n",
      "devised in any government, to secure a steady, upright, and impartial\n",
      "administration of the laws.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whoever attentively considers the different departments of power must\n",
      "perceive, that, in a government in which they are separated from each\n",
      "other, the judiciary, from the nature of its functions, will always be\n",
      "the least dangerous to the political rights of the Constitution; because\n",
      "it will be least in a capacity to annoy or injure them. The Executive\n",
      "not only dispenses the honors, but holds the sword of the community.\n",
      "The legislature not only commands the purse, but prescribes the rules\n",
      "by which the duties and rights of every citizen are to be regulated. The\n",
      "judiciary, on the contrary, has no influence over either the sword or\n",
      "the purse; no direction either of the strength or of the wealth of the\n",
      "society; and can take no active resolution whatever. It may truly be\n",
      "said to have neither FORCE nor WILL, but merely judgment; and must\n",
      "ultimately depend upon the aid of the executive arm even for the\n",
      "efficacy of its judgments.\n",
      "\n",
      "This simple view of the matter suggests several important consequences.\n",
      "It proves incontestably, that the judiciary is beyond comparison the\n",
      "weakest of the three departments of power(1); that it can never attack\n",
      "with success either of the other two; and that all possible care is\n",
      "requisite to enable it to defend itself against their attacks. It\n",
      "equally proves, that though individual oppression may now and then\n",
      "proceed from the courts of justice, the general liberty of the people\n",
      "can never be endangered from that quarter; I mean so long as the\n",
      "judiciary remains truly distinct from both the legislature and the\n",
      "Executive. For I agree, that \"there is no liberty, if the power of\n",
      "judging be not separated from the legislative and executive powers.\"(2)\n",
      "And it proves, in the last place, that as liberty can have nothing to\n",
      "fear from the judiciary alone, but would have every thing to fear from\n",
      "its union with either of the other departments; that as all the effects\n",
      "of such a union must ensue from a dependence of the former on the\n",
      "latter, notwithstanding a nominal and apparent separation; that as, from\n",
      "the natural feebleness of the judiciary, it is in continual jeopardy of\n",
      "being overpowered, awed, or influenced by its co-ordinate branches; and\n",
      "that as nothing can contribute so much to its firmness and independence\n",
      "as permanency in office, this quality may therefore be justly regarded\n",
      "as an indispensable ingredient in its constitution, and, in a great\n",
      "measure, as the citadel of the public justice and the public security.\n",
      "\n",
      "The complete independence of the courts of justice is peculiarly\n",
      "essential in a limited Constitution. By a limited Constitution, I\n",
      "understand one which contains certain specified exceptions to the\n",
      "legislative authority; such, for instance, as that it shall pass no\n",
      "bills of attainder, no ex post facto laws, and the like. Limitations\n",
      "of this kind can be preserved in practice no other way than through the\n",
      "medium of courts of justice, whose duty it must be to declare all acts\n",
      "contrary to the manifest tenor of the Constitution void. Without this,\n",
      "all the reservations of particular rights or privileges would amount to\n",
      "nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some perplexity respecting the rights of the courts to pronounce\n",
      "legislative acts void, because contrary to the Constitution, has arisen\n",
      "from an imagination that the doctrine would imply a superiority of the\n",
      "judiciary to the legislative power. It is urged that the authority which\n",
      "can declare the acts of another void, must necessarily be superior to\n",
      "the one whose acts may be declared void. As this doctrine is of great\n",
      "importance in all the American constitutions, a brief discussion of the\n",
      "ground on which it rests cannot be unacceptable.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no position which depends on clearer principles, than that\n",
      "every act of a delegated authority, contrary to the tenor of the\n",
      "commission under which it is exercised, is void. No legislative act,\n",
      "therefore, contrary to the Constitution, can be valid. To deny this,\n",
      "would be to affirm, that the deputy is greater than his principal; that\n",
      "the servant is above his master; that the representatives of the people\n",
      "are superior to the people themselves; that men acting by virtue of\n",
      "powers, may do not only what their powers do not authorize, but what\n",
      "they forbid.\n",
      "\n",
      "If it be said that the legislative body are themselves the\n",
      "constitutional judges of their own powers, and that the construction\n",
      "they put upon them is conclusive upon the other departments, it may be\n",
      "answered, that this cannot be the natural presumption, where it is not\n",
      "to be collected from any particular provisions in the Constitution. It\n",
      "is not otherwise to be supposed, that the Constitution could intend to\n",
      "enable the representatives of the people to substitute their will to\n",
      "that of their constituents. It is far more rational to suppose, that the\n",
      "courts were designed to be an intermediate body between the people and\n",
      "the legislature, in order, among other things, to keep the latter within\n",
      "the limits assigned to their authority. The interpretation of the laws\n",
      "is the proper and peculiar province of the courts. A constitution is,\n",
      "in fact, and must be regarded by the judges, as a fundamental law.\n",
      "It therefore belongs to them to ascertain its meaning, as well as the\n",
      "meaning of any particular act proceeding from the legislative body. If\n",
      "there should happen to be an irreconcilable variance between the two,\n",
      "that which has the superior obligation and validity ought, of course, to\n",
      "be preferred; or, in other words, the Constitution ought to be preferred\n",
      "to the statute, the intention of the people to the intention of their\n",
      "agents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor does this conclusion by any means suppose a superiority of the\n",
      "judicial to the legislative power. It only supposes that the power\n",
      "of the people is superior to both; and that where the will of the\n",
      "legislature, declared in its statutes, stands in opposition to that\n",
      "of the people, declared in the Constitution, the judges ought to be\n",
      "governed by the latter rather than the former. They ought to regulate\n",
      "their decisions by the fundamental laws, rather than by those which are\n",
      "not fundamental.\n",
      "\n",
      "This exercise of judicial discretion, in determining between two\n",
      "contradictory laws, is exemplified in a familiar instance. It not\n",
      "uncommonly happens, that there are two statutes existing at one time,\n",
      "clashing in whole or in part with each other, and neither of them\n",
      "containing any repealing clause or expression. In such a case, it is the\n",
      "province of the courts to liquidate and fix their meaning and operation.\n",
      "So far as they can, by any fair construction, be reconciled to each\n",
      "other, reason and law conspire to dictate that this should be done;\n",
      "where this is impracticable, it becomes a matter of necessity to give\n",
      "effect to one, in exclusion of the other. The rule which has obtained in\n",
      "the courts for determining their relative validity is, that the last in\n",
      "order of time shall be preferred to the first. But this is a mere rule\n",
      "of construction, not derived from any positive law, but from the nature\n",
      "and reason of the thing. It is a rule not enjoined upon the courts by\n",
      "legislative provision, but adopted by themselves, as consonant to truth\n",
      "and propriety, for the direction of their conduct as interpreters of the\n",
      "law. They thought it reasonable, that between the interfering acts of an\n",
      "EQUAL authority, that which was the last indication of its will should\n",
      "have the preference.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in regard to the interfering acts of a superior and subordinate\n",
      "authority, of an original and derivative power, the nature and reason of\n",
      "the thing indicate the converse of that rule as proper to be followed.\n",
      "They teach us that the prior act of a superior ought to be preferred to\n",
      "the subsequent act of an inferior and subordinate authority; and that\n",
      "accordingly, whenever a particular statute contravenes the Constitution,\n",
      "it will be the duty of the judicial tribunals to adhere to the latter\n",
      "and disregard the former.\n",
      "\n",
      "It can be of no weight to say that the courts, on the pretense of a\n",
      "repugnancy, may substitute their own pleasure to the constitutional\n",
      "intentions of the legislature. This might as well happen in the case\n",
      "of two contradictory statutes; or it might as well happen in every\n",
      "adjudication upon any single statute. The courts must declare the sense\n",
      "of the law; and if they should be disposed to exercise WILL instead of\n",
      "JUDGMENT, the consequence would equally be the substitution of their\n",
      "pleasure to that of the legislative body. The observation, if it prove\n",
      "any thing, would prove that there ought to be no judges distinct from\n",
      "that body.\n",
      "\n",
      "If, then, the courts of justice are to be considered as the bulwarks\n",
      "of a limited Constitution against legislative encroachments, this\n",
      "consideration will afford a strong argument for the permanent tenure of\n",
      "judicial offices, since nothing will contribute so much as this to that\n",
      "independent spirit in the judges which must be essential to the faithful\n",
      "performance of so arduous a duty.\n",
      "\n",
      "This independence of the judges is equally requisite to guard the\n",
      "Constitution and the rights of individuals from the effects of those ill\n",
      "humors, which the arts of designing men, or the influence of particular\n",
      "conjunctures, sometimes disseminate among the people themselves, and\n",
      "which, though they speedily give place to better information, and more\n",
      "deliberate reflection, have a tendency, in the meantime, to occasion\n",
      "dangerous innovations in the government, and serious oppressions of the\n",
      "minor party in the community. Though I trust the friends of the proposed\n",
      "Constitution will never concur with its enemies,(3) in questioning that\n",
      "fundamental principle of republican government, which admits the right\n",
      "of the people to alter or abolish the established Constitution, whenever\n",
      "they find it inconsistent with their happiness, yet it is not to be\n",
      "inferred from this principle, that the representatives of the people,\n",
      "whenever a momentary inclination happens to lay hold of a majority of\n",
      "their constituents, incompatible with the provisions in the existing\n",
      "Constitution, would, on that account, be justifiable in a violation of\n",
      "those provisions; or that the courts would be under a greater obligation\n",
      "to connive at infractions in this shape, than when they had proceeded\n",
      "wholly from the cabals of the representative body. Until the people\n",
      "have, by some solemn and authoritative act, annulled or changed the\n",
      "established form, it is binding upon themselves collectively, as well\n",
      "as individually; and no presumption, or even knowledge, of their\n",
      "sentiments, can warrant their representatives in a departure from it,\n",
      "prior to such an act. But it is easy to see, that it would require an\n",
      "uncommon portion of fortitude in the judges to do their duty as faithful\n",
      "guardians of the Constitution, where legislative invasions of it had\n",
      "been instigated by the major voice of the community.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it is not with a view to infractions of the Constitution only, that\n",
      "the independence of the judges may be an essential safeguard against the\n",
      "effects of occasional ill humors in the society. These sometimes extend\n",
      "no farther than to the injury of the private rights of particular\n",
      "classes of citizens, by unjust and partial laws. Here also the firmness\n",
      "of the judicial magistracy is of vast importance in mitigating the\n",
      "severity and confining the operation of such laws. It not only serves\n",
      "to moderate the immediate mischiefs of those which may have been passed,\n",

      "who, perceiving that obstacles to the success of iniquitous intention\n",
      "are to be expected from the scruples of the courts, are in a manner\n",
      "compelled, by the very motives of the injustice they meditate, to\n",

      "That inflexible and uniform adherence to the rights of the Constitution,\n",
      "and of individuals, which we perceive to be indispensable in the courts\n",

      "offices by a temporary commission. Periodical appointments, however\n",
      "regulated, or by whomsoever made, would, in some way or other, be\n",
      "fatal to their necessary independence. If the power of making them was\n",
      "committed either to the Executive or legislature, there would be danger\n",
      "of an improper complaisance to the branch which possessed it; if to\n",
      "both, there would be an unwillingness to hazard the displeasure of\n",

      "There is yet a further and a weightier reason for the permanency of\n",

      "qualifications they require. It has been frequently remarked, with great\n",
      "propriety, that a voluminous code of laws is one of the inconveniences\n",
      "necessarily connected with the advantages of a free government. To avoid\n",
      "an arbitrary discretion in the courts, it is indispensable that they\n",
      "should be bound down by strict rules and precedents, which serve to\n",

      "before them; and it will readily be conceived from the variety of\n",
      "controversies which grow out of the folly and wickedness of mankind,\n",
      "that the records of those precedents must unavoidably swell to a very\n",
      "considerable bulk, and must demand long and laborious study to acquire a\n",
      "competent knowledge of them. Hence it is, that there can be but few men\n",
      "in the society who will have sufficient skill in the laws to qualify\n",
      "them for the stations of judges. And making the proper deductions for\n",
      "the ordinary depravity of human nature, the number must be still smaller\n",
      "of those who unite the requisite integrity with the requisite knowledge.\n",
      "These considerations apprise us, that the government can have no great\n",

      "which would naturally discourage such characters from quitting a\n",
      "lucrative line of practice to accept a seat on the bench, would have a\n",
      "tendency to throw the administration of justice into hands less able,\n",

      "remark made in relation to the President is equally applicable here.\n",
      "In the general course of human nature, a power over a man's subsistence\n",
      "amounts to a power over his will. And we can never hope to see\n",
      "realized in practice, the complete separation of the judicial from the\n",
      "legislative power, in any system which leaves the former dependent\n",
      "for pecuniary resources on the occasional grants of the latter. The\n",
      "enlightened friends to good government in every State, have seen cause\n",
      "to lament the want of precise and explicit precautions in the State\n",
      "constitutions on this head. Some of these indeed have declared that\n",
      "permanent(1) salaries should be established for the judges; but the\n",
      "experiment has in some instances shown that such expressions are not\n",
      "sufficiently definite to preclude legislative evasions. Something still\n",
      "more positive and unequivocal has been evinced to be requisite. The plan\n",
      "of the convention accordingly has provided that the judges of the United\n",
      "States \"shall at stated times receive for their services a compensation\n",
      "which shall not be diminished during their continuance in office.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This, all circumstances considered, is the most eligible provision\n",
      "that could have been devised. It will readily be understood that the\n",
      "fluctuations in the value of money and in the state of society rendered\n",
      "a fixed rate of compensation in the Constitution inadmissible. What\n",
      "might be extravagant to-day, might in half a century become penurious\n",
      "and inadequate. It was therefore necessary to leave it to the discretion\n",

      "variations in circumstances, yet under such restrictions as to put it\n",
      "out of the power of that body to change the condition of the individual\n",
      "for the worse. A man may then be sure of the ground upon which he\n",
      "stands, and can never be deterred from his duty by the apprehension of\n",
      "being placed in a less eligible situation. The clause which has been\n",
      "quoted combines both advantages. The salaries of judicial officers may\n",
      "from time to time be altered, as occasion shall require, yet so as\n",
      "never to lessen the allowance with which any particular judge comes into\n",
      "office, in respect to him. It will be observed that a difference has\n",

      "and of the judges, That of the former can neither be increased nor\n",
      "diminished; that of the latter can only not be diminished. This probably\n",
      "arose from the difference in the duration of the respective offices.\n",
      "As the President is to be elected for no more than four years, it can\n",
      "rarely happen that an adequate salary, fixed at the commencement of that\n",
      "period, will not continue to be such to its end. But with regard to the\n",
      "judges, who, if they behave properly, will be secured in their places\n",
      "for life, it may well happen, especially in the early stages of the\n",
      "government, that a stipend, which would be very sufficient at their\n",
      "first appointment, would become too small in the progress of their\n",
      "service.\n",
      "\n",
      "This provision for the support of the judges bears every mark of\n",
      "prudence and efficacy; and it may be safely affirmed that, together with\n",
      "the permanent tenure of their offices, it affords a better prospect of\n",
      "their independence than is discoverable in the constitutions of any of\n",

      "only one which we find in our own Constitution in respect to our own\n",
      "judges.\n",

      "The want of a provision for removing the judges on account of inability\n",

      "sensible that such a provision would either not be practiced upon\n",
      "or would be more liable to abuse than calculated to answer any good\n",

      "it will be necessary to consider, in the first place, what are its\n",
      "proper objects.\n",
      "\n",
      "It seems scarcely to admit of controversy, that the judiciary authority\n",
      "of the Union ought to extend to these several descriptions of cases:\n",
      "1st, to all those which arise out of the laws of the United States,\n",
      "passed in pursuance of their just and constitutional powers of\n",
      "legislation; 2d, to all those which concern the execution of the\n",
      "provisions expressly contained in the articles of Union; 3d, to all\n",
      "those in which the United States are a party; 4th, to all those which\n",
      "involve the PEACE of the CONFEDERACY, whether they relate to the\n",
      "intercourse between the United States and foreign nations, or to that\n",
      "between the States themselves; 5th, to all those which originate on the\n",

      "to all those in which the State tribunals cannot be supposed to be\n",
      "impartial and unbiased.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first point depends upon this obvious consideration, that there\n",
      "ought always to be a constitutional method of giving efficacy to\n",
      "constitutional provisions. What, for instance, would avail restrictions\n",
      "on the authority of the State legislatures, without some constitutional\n",
      "mode of enforcing the observance of them? The States, by the plan of the\n",
      "convention, are prohibited from doing a variety of things, some of which\n",
      "are incompatible with the interests of the Union, and others with the\n",
      "principles of good government. The imposition of duties on imported\n",
      "articles, and the emission of paper money, are specimens of each\n",
      "kind. No man of sense will believe, that such prohibitions would be\n",
      "scrupulously regarded, without some effectual power in the government to\n",
      "restrain or correct the infractions of them. This power must either be a\n",
      "direct negative on the State laws, or an authority in the federal courts\n",
      "to overrule such as might be in manifest contravention of the articles\n",
      "of Union. There is no third course that I can imagine. The latter\n",
      "appears to have been thought by the convention preferable to the former,\n",
      "and, I presume, will be most agreeable to the States.\n",
      "\n",
      "As to the second point, it is impossible, by any argument or comment,\n",
      "to make it clearer than it is in itself. If there are such things as\n",
      "political axioms, the propriety of the judicial power of a government\n",
      "being coextensive with its legislative, may be ranked among the number.\n",
      "The mere necessity of uniformity in the interpretation of the national\n",
      "laws, decides the question. Thirteen independent courts of final\n",
      "jurisdiction over the same causes, arising upon the same laws, is a\n",
      "hydra in government, from which nothing but contradiction and confusion\n",
      "can proceed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still less need be said in regard to the third point. Controversies\n",
      "between the nation and its members or citizens, can only be properly\n",
      "referred to the national tribunals. Any other plan would be contrary to\n",
      "reason, to precedent, and to decorum.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fourth point rests on this plain proposition, that the peace of the\n",
      "WHOLE ought not to be left at the disposal of a PART. The Union will\n",
      "undoubtedly be answerable to foreign powers for the conduct of\n",
      "its members. And the responsibility for an injury ought ever to\n",
      "be accompanied with the faculty of preventing it. As the denial or\n",
      "perversion of justice by the sentences of courts, as well as in any\n",
      "other manner, is with reason classed among the just causes of war, it\n",
      "will follow that the federal judiciary ought to have cognizance of all\n",
      "causes in which the citizens of other countries are concerned. This is\n",
      "not less essential to the preservation of the public faith, than to\n",
      "the security of the public tranquillity. A distinction may perhaps be\n",
      "imagined between cases arising upon treaties and the laws of nations and\n",
      "those which may stand merely on the footing of the municipal law. The\n",
      "former kind may be supposed proper for the federal jurisdiction, the\n",
      "latter for that of the States. But it is at least problematical, whether\n",
      "an unjust sentence against a foreigner, where the subject of controversy\n",
      "was wholly relative to the lex loci, would not, if unredressed, be\n",
      "an aggression upon his sovereign, as well as one which violated the\n",
      "stipulations of a treaty or the general law of nations. And a still\n",
      "greater objection to the distinction would result from the immense\n",
      "difficulty, if not impossibility, of a practical discrimination\n",
      "between the cases of one complexion and those of the other. So great\n",
      "a proportion of the cases in which foreigners are parties, involve\n",
      "national questions, that it is by far most safe and most expedient to\n",

      "The power of determining causes between two States, between one State\n",
      "and the citizens of another, and between the citizens of different\n",

      "that which has been just examined. History gives us a horrid picture of\n",
      "the dissensions and private wars which distracted and desolated Germany\n",
      "prior to the institution of the Imperial Chamber by Maximilian, towards\n",
      "the close of the fifteenth century; and informs us, at the same time,\n",
      "of the vast influence of that institution in appeasing the disorders and\n",

      "the Germanic body.\n",
      "\n",
      "A method of terminating territorial disputes between the States, under\n",
      "the authority of the federal head, was not unattended to, even in the\n",
      "imperfect system by which they have been hitherto held together. But\n",
      "there are many other sources, besides interfering claims of boundary,\n",
      "from which bickerings and animosities may spring up among the members of\n",
      "the Union. To some of these we have been witnesses in the course of our\n",
      "past experience. It will readily be conjectured that I allude to the\n",
      "fraudulent laws which have been passed in too many of the States. And\n",
      "though the proposed Constitution establishes particular guards against\n",
      "the repetition of those instances which have heretofore made their\n",
      "appearance, yet it is warrantable to apprehend that the spirit which\n",
      "produced them will assume new shapes, that could not be foreseen nor\n",
      "specifically provided against. Whatever practices may have a tendency\n",
      "to disturb the harmony between the States, are proper objects of federal\n",
      "superintendence and control.\n",

      "It may be esteemed the basis of the Union, that \"the citizens of each\n",

      "of the several States.\" And if it be a just principle that every\n",
      "government ought to possess the means of executing its own provisions\n",
      "by its own authority, it will follow, that in order to the inviolable\n",
      "maintenance of that equality of privileges and immunities to which the\n",
      "citizens of the Union will be entitled, the national judiciary ought to\n",
      "preside in all cases in which one State or its citizens are opposed\n",
      "to another State or its citizens. To secure the full effect of so\n",
      "fundamental a provision against all evasion and subterfuge, it is\n",
      "necessary that its construction should be committed to that tribunal\n",
      "which, having no local attachments, will be likely to be impartial\n",
      "between the different States and their citizens, and which, owing its\n",
      "official existence to the Union, will never be likely to feel any bias\n",
      "inauspicious to the principles on which it is founded.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fifth point will demand little animadversion. The most bigoted\n",
      "idolizers of State authority have not thus far shown a disposition to\n",
      "deny the national judiciary the cognizances of maritime causes. These\n",
      "so generally depend on the laws of nations, and so commonly affect the\n",
      "rights of foreigners, that they fall within the considerations which are\n",
      "relative to the public peace. The most important part of them are, by\n",
      "the present Confederation, submitted to federal jurisdiction.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reasonableness of the agency of the national courts in cases in\n",
      "which the State tribunals cannot be supposed to be impartial, speaks for\n",
      "itself. No man ought certainly to be a judge in his own cause, or in\n",
      "any cause in respect to which he has the least interest or bias. This\n",
      "principle has no inconsiderable weight in designating the federal courts\n",
      "as the proper tribunals for the determination of controversies between\n",
      "different States and their citizens. And it ought to have the same\n",
      "operation in regard to some cases between citizens of the same State.\n",
      "Claims to land under grants of different States, founded upon adverse\n",
      "pretensions of boundary, are of this description. The courts of neither\n",
      "of the granting States could be expected to be unbiased. The laws may\n",
      "have even prejudged the question, and tied the courts down to decisions\n",
      "in favor of the grants of the State to which they belonged. And even\n",

      "by \"cases arising under the Constitution,\" in contradiction from those\n",
      "\"arising under the laws of the United States\"? The difference has been\n",
      "already explained. All the restrictions upon the authority of the State\n",
      "legislatures furnish examples of it. They are not, for instance, to emit\n",
      "paper money; but the interdiction results from the Constitution, and\n",
      "will have no connection with any law of the United States. Should paper\n",
      "money, notwithstanding, be emited, the controversies concerning it would\n",

      "several of the States. It is the peculiar province, for instance, of a\n",
      "court of equity to relieve against what are called hard bargains: these\n",
      "are contracts in which, though there may have been no direct fraud or\n",

      "may have been some undue and unconscionable advantage taken of the\n",

      "of equity would not tolerate. In such cases, where foreigners were\n",

      "jurisdiction. Agreements to convey lands claimed under the grants of\n",

      "of the Supreme Court of the United States will be uncontrollable\n",
      "and remediless.\" This, upon examination, will be found to be made up\n",
      "altogether of false reasoning upon misconceived fact.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first place, there is not a syllable in the plan under\n",
      "consideration which directly empowers the national courts to construe\n",
      "the laws according to the spirit of the Constitution, or which gives\n",
      "them any greater latitude in this respect than may be claimed by the\n",
      "courts of every State. I admit, however, that the Constitution ought to\n",
      "be the standard of construction for the laws, and that wherever there is\n",
      "an evident opposition, the laws ought to give place to the Constitution.\n",
      "But this doctrine is not deducible from any circumstance peculiar to\n",
      "the plan of the convention, but from the general theory of a limited\n",
      "Constitution; and as far as it is true, is equally applicable to\n",
      "most, if not to all the State governments. There can be no objection,\n",
      "therefore, on this account, to the federal judicature which will not lie\n",
      "against the local judicatures in general, and which will not serve to\n",
      "condemn every constitution that attempts to set bounds to legislative\n",
      "discretion.\n",
      "\n",
      "But perhaps the force of the objection may be thought to consist in the\n",
      "particular organization of the Supreme Court; in its being composed of\n",
      "a distinct body of magistrates, instead of being one of the branches of\n",
      "the legislature, as in the government of Great Britain and that of the\n",
      "State. To insist upon this point, the authors of the objection must\n",
      "renounce the meaning they have labored to annex to the celebrated\n",
      "maxim, requiring a separation of the departments of power. It shall,\n",
      "nevertheless, be conceded to them, agreeably to the interpretation given\n",

      "vesting the ultimate power of judging in a PART of the legislative body.\n",
      "But though this be not an absolute violation of that excellent rule,\n",
      "yet it verges so nearly upon it, as on this account alone to be less\n",
      "eligible than the mode preferred by the convention. From a body which\n",
      "had even a partial agency in passing bad laws, we could rarely expect\n",
      "a disposition to temper and moderate them in the application. The\n",
      "same spirit which had operated in making them, would be too apt in\n",
      "interpreting them; still less could it be expected that men who had\n",
      "infringed the Constitution in the character of legislators, would be\n",
      "disposed to repair the breach in the character of judges. Nor is this\n",
      "all. Every reason which recommends the tenure of good behavior for\n",
      "judicial offices, militates against placing the judiciary power, in\n",
      "the last resort, in a body composed of men chosen for a limited period.\n",
      "There is an absurdity in referring the determination of causes, in the\n",
      "first instance, to judges of permanent standing; in the last, to those\n",
      "of a temporary and mutable constitution. And there is a still greater\n",
      "absurdity in subjecting the decisions of men, selected for their\n",
      "knowledge of the laws, acquired by long and laborious study, to the\n",
      "revision and control of men who, for want of the same advantage, cannot\n",
      "but be deficient in that knowledge. The members of the legislature will\n",
      "rarely be chosen with a view to those qualifications which fit men for\n",
      "the stations of judges; and as, on this account, there will be great\n",
      "reason to apprehend all the ill consequences of defective information,\n",
      "so, on account of the natural propensity of such bodies to party\n",
      "divisions, there will be no less reason to fear that the pestilential\n",
      "breath of faction may poison the fountains of justice. The habit of\n",
      "being continually marshalled on opposite sides will be too apt to stifle\n",
      "the voice both of law and of equity.\n",
      "\n",
      "These considerations teach us to applaud the wisdom of those States who\n",
      "have committed the judicial power, in the last resort, not to a part of\n",
      "the legislature, but to distinct and independent bodies of men. Contrary\n",
      "to the supposition of those who have represented the plan of the\n",
      "convention, in this respect, as novel and unprecedented, it is but a\n",
      "copy of the constitutions of New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania,\n",
      "Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and\n",
      "Georgia; and the preference which has been given to those models is\n",
      "highly to be commended.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is not true, in the second place, that the Parliament of Great\n",
      "Britain, or the legislatures of the particular States, can rectify the\n",
      "exceptionable decisions of their respective courts, in any other sense\n",
      "than might be done by a future legislature of the United States. The\n",
      "theory, neither of the British, nor the State constitutions, authorizes\n",
      "the revisal of a judicial sentence by a legislative act. Nor is there\n",
      "any thing in the proposed Constitution, more than in either of them,\n",
      "by which it is forbidden. In the former, as well as in the latter, the\n",
      "impropriety of the thing, on the general principles of law and reason,\n",
      "is the sole obstacle. A legislature, without exceeding its province,\n",
      "cannot reverse a determination once made in a particular case; though it\n",
      "may prescribe a new rule for future cases. This is the principle, and it\n",
      "applies in all its consequences, exactly in the same manner and extent,\n",
      "to the State governments, as to the national government now under\n",
      "consideration. Not the least difference can be pointed out in any view\n",
      "of the subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "It may in the last place be observed that the supposed danger of\n",
      "judiciary encroachments on the legislative authority, which has been\n",
      "upon many occasions reiterated, is in reality a phantom. Particular\n",
      "misconstructions and contraventions of the will of the legislature may\n",
      "now and then happen; but they can never be so extensive as to amount to\n",
      "an inconvenience, or in any sensible degree to affect the order of the\n",
      "political system. This may be inferred with certainty, from the general\n",
      "nature of the judicial power, from the objects to which it relates, from\n",
      "the manner in which it is exercised, from its comparative weakness, and\n",
      "from its total incapacity to support its usurpations by force. And the\n",
      "inference is greatly fortified by the consideration of the important\n",
      "constitutional check which the power of instituting impeachments in one\n",
      "part of the legislative body, and of determining upon them in the other,\n",
      "would give to that body upon the members of the judicial department.\n",
      "This is alone a complete security. There never can be danger that the\n",
      "judges, by a series of deliberate usurpations on the authority of the\n",
      "legislature, would hazard the united resentment of the body intrusted\n",
      "with it, while this body was possessed of the means of punishing their\n",
      "presumption, by degrading them from their stations. While this ought to\n",
      "remove all apprehensions on the subject, it affords, at the same time,\n",
      "a cogent argument for constituting the Senate a court for the trial of\n",
      "impeachments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having now examined, and, I trust, removed the objections to the\n",
      "distinct and independent organization of the Supreme Court, I proceed to\n",
      "consider the propriety of the power of constituting inferior courts,(2)\n",
      "and the relations which will subsist between these and the former.\n",
      "\n",
      "The power of constituting inferior courts is evidently calculated to\n",
      "obviate the necessity of having recourse to the Supreme Court in every\n",
      "case of federal cognizance. It is intended to enable the national\n",
      "government to institute or authorize, in each State or district of the\n",
      "United States, a tribunal competent to the determination of matters of\n",
      "national jurisdiction within its limits.\n",
      "\n",
      "But why, it is asked, might not the same purpose have been accomplished\n",
      "by the instrumentality of the State courts? This admits of different\n",
      "answers. Though the fitness and competency of those courts should\n",
      "be allowed in the utmost latitude, yet the substance of the power in\n",
      "question may still be regarded as a necessary part of the plan, if it\n",
      "were only to empower the national legislature to commit to them the\n",
      "cognizance of causes arising out of the national Constitution. To confer\n",
      "the power of determining such causes upon the existing courts of the\n",
      "several States, would perhaps be as much \"to constitute tribunals,\" as\n",
      "to create new courts with the like power. But ought not a more direct\n",
      "and explicit provision to have been made in favor of the State courts?\n",
      "There are, in my opinion, substantial reasons against such a provision:\n",
      "the most discerning cannot foresee how far the prevalency of a\n",
      "local spirit may be found to disqualify the local tribunals for the\n",
      "jurisdiction of national causes; whilst every man may discover, that\n",
      "courts constituted like those of some of the States would be improper\n",
      "channels of the judicial authority of the Union. State judges, holding\n",
      "their offices during pleasure, or from year to year, will be too\n",
      "little independent to be relied upon for an inflexible execution of the\n",
      "national laws. And if there was a necessity for confiding the original\n",
      "cognizance of causes arising under those laws to them there would be\n",
      "a correspondent necessity for leaving the door of appeal as wide as\n",
      "possible. In proportion to the grounds of confidence in, or distrust\n",
      "of, the subordinate tribunals, ought to be the facility or difficulty\n",
      "of appeals. And well satisfied as I am of the propriety of the appellate\n",
      "jurisdiction, in the several classes of causes to which it is extended\n",
      "by the plan of the convention. I should consider every thing calculated\n",
      "to give, in practice, an unrestrained course to appeals, as a source of\n",
      "public and private inconvenience.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am not sure, but that it will be found highly expedient and useful,\n",
      "to divide the United States into four or five or half a dozen districts;\n",
      "and to institute a federal court in each district, in lieu of one in\n",
      "every State. The judges of these courts, with the aid of the State\n",
      "judges, may hold circuits for the trial of causes in the several parts\n",
      "of the respective districts. Justice through them may be administered\n",
      "with ease and despatch; and appeals may be safely circumscribed within a\n",
      "narrow compass. This plan appears to me at present the most eligible of\n",
      "any that could be adopted; and in order to it, it is necessary that the\n",
      "power of constituting inferior courts should exist in the full extent in\n",
      "which it is to be found in the proposed Constitution.\n",
      "\n",
      "These reasons seem sufficient to satisfy a candid mind, that the want\n",
      "of such a power would have been a great defect in the plan. Let us\n",
      "now examine in what manner the judicial authority is to be distributed\n",
      "between the supreme and the inferior courts of the Union.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Supreme Court is to be invested with original jurisdiction, only \"in\n",
      "cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls, and\n",
      "those in which A STATE shall be a party.\" Public ministers of every\n",
      "class are the immediate representatives of their sovereigns. All\n",
      "questions in which they are concerned are so directly connected with\n",
      "the public peace, that, as well for the preservation of this, as out of\n",
      "respect to the sovereignties they represent, it is both expedient and\n",
      "proper that such questions should be submitted in the first instance\n",
      "to the highest judicatory of the nation. Though consuls have not in\n",
      "strictness a diplomatic character, yet as they are the public agents\n",
      "of the nations to which they belong, the same observation is in a great\n",
      "measure applicable to them. In cases in which a State might happen to be\n",
      "a party, it would ill suit its dignity to be turned over to an inferior\n",
      "tribunal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though it may rather be a digression from the immediate subject of this\n",
      "paper, I shall take occasion to mention here a supposition which has\n",
      "excited some alarm upon very mistaken grounds. It has been suggested\n",
      "that an assignment of the public securities of one State to the citizens\n",
      "of another, would enable them to prosecute that State in the federal\n",
      "courts for the amount of those securities; a suggestion which the\n",
      "following considerations prove to be without foundation.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is inherent in the nature of sovereignty not to be amenable to the\n",
      "suit of an individual without its consent. This is the general sense,\n",
      "and the general practice of mankind; and the exemption, as one of the\n",
      "attributes of sovereignty, is now enjoyed by the government of every\n",
      "State in the Union. Unless, therefore, there is a surrender of this\n",
      "immunity in the plan of the convention, it will remain with the States,\n",
      "and the danger intimated must be merely ideal. The circumstances\n",
      "which are necessary to produce an alienation of State sovereignty\n",
      "were discussed in considering the article of taxation, and need not be\n",
      "repeated here. A recurrence to the principles there established will\n",
      "satisfy us, that there is no color to pretend that the State governments\n",
      "would, by the adoption of that plan, be divested of the privilege of\n",
      "paying their own debts in their own way, free from every constraint\n",
      "but that which flows from the obligations of good faith. The contracts\n",
      "between a nation and individuals are only binding on the conscience\n",
      "of the sovereign, and have no pretensions to a compulsive force. They\n",
      "confer no right of action, independent of the sovereign will. To what\n",
      "purpose would it be to authorize suits against States for the debts they\n",
      "owe? How could recoveries be enforced? It is evident, it could not be\n",
      "done without waging war against the contracting State; and to ascribe\n",
      "to the federal courts, by mere implication, and in destruction of a\n",
      "pre-existing right of the State governments, a power which would involve\n",
      "such a consequence, would be altogether forced and unwarrantable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us resume the train of our observations. We have seen that the\n",
      "original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court would be confined to two\n",
      "classes of causes, and those of a nature rarely to occur. In all other\n",
      "cases of federal cognizance, the original jurisdiction would appertain\n",
      "to the inferior tribunals; and the Supreme Court would have nothing more\n",
      "than an appellate jurisdiction, \"with such exceptions and under such\n",
      "regulations as the Congress shall make.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The propriety of this appellate jurisdiction has been scarcely called\n",
      "in question in regard to matters of law; but the clamors have been loud\n",
      "against it as applied to matters of fact. Some well-intentioned men in\n",
      "this State, deriving their notions from the language and forms which\n",
      "obtain in our courts, have been induced to consider it as an implied\n",
      "supersedure of the trial by jury, in favor of the civil-law mode of\n",
      "trial, which prevails in our courts of admiralty, probate, and chancery.\n",
      "A technical sense has been affixed to the term \"appellate,\" which, in\n",
      "our law parlance, is commonly used in reference to appeals in the course\n",
      "of the civil law. But if I am not misinformed, the same meaning would\n",
      "not be given to it in any part of New England. There an appeal from one\n",
      "jury to another, is familiar both in language and practice, and is even\n",
      "a matter of course, until there have been two verdicts on one side. The\n",
      "word \"appellate,\" therefore, will not be understood in the same sense in\n",
      "New England as in New York, which shows the impropriety of a technical\n",
      "interpretation derived from the jurisprudence of any particular State.\n",
      "The expression, taken in the abstract, denotes nothing more than the\n",

      "to the law or fact, or both. The mode of doing it may depend on ancient\n",
      "custom or legislative provision (in a new government it must depend on\n",
      "the latter), and may be with or without the aid of a jury, as may be\n",
      "judged advisable. If, therefore, the re-examination of a fact once\n",
      "determined by a jury, should in any case be admitted under the proposed\n",

      "it cannot institute a new inquiry concerning the fact, but it takes\n",
      "cognizance of it as it appears upon the record, and pronounces the law\n",

      "it even possible to separate them. Though the common-law courts of this\n",
      "State ascertain disputed facts by a jury, yet they unquestionably have\n",
      "jurisdiction of both fact and law; and accordingly when the former is\n",
      "agreed in the pleadings, they have no recourse to a jury, but proceed\n",
      "at once to judgment. I contend, therefore, on this ground, that the\n",
      "expressions, \"appellate jurisdiction, both as to law and fact,\" do not\n",
      "necessarily imply a re-examination in the Supreme Court of facts decided\n",

      "to causes determinable in different modes, some in the course of the\n",
      "COMMON LAW, others in the course of the CIVIL LAW. In the former,\n",
      "the revision of the law only will be, generally speaking, the proper\n",
      "province of the Supreme Court; in the latter, the re-examination of the\n",
      "fact is agreeable to usage, and in some cases, of which prize causes are\n",
      "an example, might be essential to the preservation of the public peace.\n",
      "It is therefore necessary that the appellate jurisdiction should, in\n",
      "certain cases, extend in the broadest sense to matters of fact. It will\n",
      "not answer to make an express exception of cases which shall have been\n",
      "originally tried by a jury, because in the courts of some of the States\n",
      "all causes are tried in this mode(4); and such an exception would\n",
      "preclude the revision of matters of fact, as well where it might be\n",
      "proper, as where it might be improper. To avoid all inconveniencies,\n",
      "it will be safest to declare generally, that the Supreme Court shall\n",
      "possess appellate jurisdiction both as to law and fact, and that this\n",
      "jurisdiction shall be subject to such exceptions and regulations as the\n",

      "Such questions, accordingly, have arisen upon the plan proposed by the\n",

      "principal of these respect the situation of the State courts in regard\n",

      "of men of sense, and which are certainly entitled to attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "The principles established in a former paper(1) teach us that the States\n",
      "will retain all pre-existing authorities which may not be exclusively\n",
      "delegated to the federal head; and that this exclusive delegation can\n",
      "only exist in one of three cases: where an exclusive authority is, in\n",
      "express terms, granted to the Union; or where a particular authority is\n",
      "granted to the Union, and the exercise of a like authority is prohibited\n",
      "to the States; or where an authority is granted to the Union, with which\n",
      "a similar authority in the States would be utterly incompatible. Though\n",
      "these principles may not apply with the same force to the judiciary as\n",
      "to the legislative power, yet I am inclined to think that they are, in\n",
      "the main, just with respect to the former, as well as the latter. And\n",

      "courts will retain the jurisdiction they now have, unless it appears to\n",
      "be taken away in one of the enumerated modes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only thing in the proposed Constitution, which wears the appearance\n",
      "of confining the causes of federal cognizance to the federal courts,\n",
      "is contained in this passage: \"THE JUDICIAL POWER of the United States\n",
      "shall be vested in one Supreme Court, and in such inferior courts as\n",
      "the Congress shall from time to time ordain and establish.\" This might\n",
      "either be construed to signify, that the supreme and subordinate courts\n",
      "of the Union should alone have the power of deciding those causes to\n",
      "which their authority is to extend; or simply to denote, that the organs\n",
      "of the national judiciary should be one Supreme Court, and as many\n",
      "subordinate courts as Congress should think proper to appoint; or in\n",
      "other words, that the United States should exercise the judicial power\n",
      "with which they are to be invested, through one supreme tribunal, and\n",
      "a certain number of inferior ones, to be instituted by them. The first\n",
      "excludes, the last admits, the concurrent jurisdiction of the State\n",
      "tribunals; and as the first would amount to an alienation of State power\n",
      "by implication, the last appears to me the most natural and the most\n",
      "defensible construction.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this doctrine of concurrent jurisdiction is only clearly applicable\n",
      "to those descriptions of causes of which the State courts have previous\n",
      "cognizance. It is not equally evident in relation to cases which may\n",
      "grow out of, and be peculiar to, the Constitution to be established; for\n",
      "not to allow the State courts a right of jurisdiction in such cases, can\n",
      "hardly be considered as the abridgment of a pre-existing authority. I\n",
      "mean not therefore to contend that the United States, in the course\n",
      "of legislation upon the objects intrusted to their direction, may not\n",
      "commit the decision of causes arising upon a particular regulation to\n",
      "the federal courts solely, if such a measure should be deemed expedient;\n",
      "but I hold that the State courts will be divested of no part of their\n",
      "primitive jurisdiction, further than may relate to an appeal; and I\n",
      "am even of opinion that in every case in which they were not expressly\n",
      "excluded by the future acts of the national legislature, they will of\n",
      "course take cognizance of the causes to which those acts may give birth.\n",
      "This I infer from the nature of judiciary power, and from the general\n",
      "genius of the system. The judiciary power of every government looks\n",
      "beyond its own local or municipal laws, and in civil cases lays hold\n",
      "of all subjects of litigation between parties within its jurisdiction,\n",
      "though the causes of dispute are relative to the laws of the most\n",
      "distant part of the globe. Those of Japan, not less than of New York,\n",
      "may furnish the objects of legal discussion to our courts. When in\n",
      "addition to this we consider the State governments and the national\n",
      "governments, as they truly are, in the light of kindred systems, and as\n",
      "parts of ONE WHOLE, the inference seems to be conclusive, that the State\n",
      "courts would have a concurrent jurisdiction in all cases arising under\n",
      "the laws of the Union, where it was not expressly prohibited.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here another question occurs: What relation would subsist between the\n",
      "national and State courts in these instances of concurrent jurisdiction?\n",
      "I answer, that an appeal would certainly lie from the latter, to the\n",
      "Supreme Court of the United States. The Constitution in direct terms\n",
      "gives an appellate jurisdiction to the Supreme Court in all the\n",
      "enumerated cases of federal cognizance in which it is not to have an\n",
      "original one, without a single expression to confine its operation to\n",
      "the inferior federal courts. The objects of appeal, not the tribunals\n",
      "from which it is to be made, are alone contemplated. From this\n",
      "circumstance, and from the reason of the thing, it ought to be construed\n",
      "to extend to the State tribunals. Either this must be the case, or the\n",
      "local courts must be excluded from a concurrent jurisdiction in matters\n",
      "of national concern, else the judiciary authority of the Union may be\n",
      "eluded at the pleasure of every plaintiff or prosecutor. Neither of\n",
      "these consequences ought, without evident necessity, to be involved; the\n",
      "latter would be entirely inadmissible, as it would defeat some of the\n",
      "most important and avowed purposes of the proposed government, and would\n",
      "essentially embarrass its measures. Nor do I perceive any foundation for\n",
      "such a supposition. Agreeably to the remark already made, the national\n",
      "and State systems are to be regarded as ONE WHOLE. The courts of the\n",
      "latter will of course be natural auxiliaries to the execution of the\n",
      "laws of the Union, and an appeal from them will as naturally lie to that\n",
      "tribunal which is destined to unite and assimilate the principles of\n",
      "national justice and the rules of national decisions. The evident aim\n",
      "of the plan of the convention is, that all the causes of the specified\n",
      "classes shall, for weighty public reasons, receive their original or\n",
      "final determination in the courts of the Union. To confine, therefore,\n",
      "the general expressions giving appellate jurisdiction to the Supreme\n",
      "Court, to appeals from the subordinate federal courts, instead of\n",
      "allowing their extension to the State courts, would be to abridge the\n",
      "latitude of the terms, in subversion of the intent, contrary to every\n",
      "sound rule of interpretation.\n",
      "\n",
      "But could an appeal be made to lie from the State courts to the\n",
      "subordinate federal judicatories? This is another of the questions\n",
      "which have been raised, and of greater difficulty than the former. The\n",
      "following considerations countenance the affirmative. The plan of the\n",
      "convention, in the first place, authorizes the national legislature \"to\n",
      "constitute tribunals inferior to the Supreme Court.\"(2) It declares, in\n",
      "the next place, that \"the JUDICIAL POWER of the United States shall be\n",
      "vested in one Supreme Court, and in such inferior courts as Congress\n",
      "shall ordain and establish\"; and it then proceeds to enumerate the cases\n",
      "to which this judicial power shall extend. It afterwards divides the\n",
      "jurisdiction of the Supreme Court into original and appellate, but\n",
      "gives no definition of that of the subordinate courts. The only outlines\n",
      "described for them, are that they shall be \"inferior to the Supreme\n",
      "Court,\" and that they shall not exceed the specified limits of the\n",
      "federal judiciary. Whether their authority shall be original or\n",
      "appellate, or both, is not declared. All this seems to be left to the\n",
      "discretion of the legislature. And this being the case, I perceive at\n",
      "present no impediment to the establishment of an appeal from the State\n",
      "courts to the subordinate national tribunals; and many advantages\n",
      "attending the power of doing it may be imagined. It would diminish the\n",
      "motives to the multiplication of federal courts, and would admit of\n",
      "arrangements calculated to contract the appellate jurisdiction of the\n",
      "Supreme Court. The State tribunals may then be left with a more entire\n",
      "charge of federal causes; and appeals, in most cases in which they may\n",
      "be deemed proper, instead of being carried to the Supreme Court, may be\n",

      "THE objection to the plan of the convention, which has met with most\n",
      "success in this State, and perhaps in several of the other States, is\n",
      "that relative to the want of a constitutional provision for the trial\n",
      "by jury in civil cases. The disingenuous form in which this objection\n",
      "is usually stated has been repeatedly adverted to and exposed, but\n",
      "continues to be pursued in all the conversations and writings of the\n",
      "opponents of the plan. The mere silence of the Constitution in regard to\n",
      "civil causes, is represented as an abolition of the trial by jury,\n",
      "and the declamations to which it has afforded a pretext are artfully\n",
      "calculated to induce a persuasion that this pretended abolition is\n",
      "complete and universal, extending not only to every species of civil,\n",
      "but even to criminal causes. To argue with respect to the latter would,\n",
      "however, be as vain and fruitless as to attempt the serious proof of the\n",
      "existence of matter, or to demonstrate any of those propositions which,\n",
      "by their own internal evidence, force conviction, when expressed in\n",
      "language adapted to convey their meaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "With regard to civil causes, subtleties almost too contemptible for\n",
      "refutation have been employed to countenance the surmise that a thing\n",
      "which is only not provided for, is entirely abolished. Every man of\n",
      "discernment must at once perceive the wide difference between silence\n",
      "and abolition. But as the inventors of this fallacy have attempted to\n",
      "support it by certain legal maxims of interpretation, which they have\n",
      "perverted from their true meaning, it may not be wholly useless to\n",
      "explore the ground they have taken.\n",
      "\n",
      "The maxims on which they rely are of this nature: \"A specification of\n",
      "particulars is an exclusion of generals\"; or, \"The expression of one\n",
      "thing is the exclusion of another.\" Hence, say they, as the Constitution\n",
      "has established the trial by jury in criminal cases, and is silent in\n",
      "respect to civil, this silence is an implied prohibition of trial by\n",
      "jury in regard to the latter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rules of legal interpretation are rules of common sense, adopted by\n",
      "the courts in the construction of the laws. The true test, therefore,\n",
      "of a just application of them is its conformity to the source from which\n",
      "they are derived. This being the case, let me ask if it is consistent\n",
      "with common-sense to suppose that a provision obliging the legislative\n",
      "power to commit the trial of criminal causes to juries, is a privation\n",
      "of its right to authorize or permit that mode of trial in other\n",
      "cases? Is it natural to suppose, that a command to do one thing is a\n",
      "prohibition to the doing of another, which there was a previous power to\n",
      "do, and which is not incompatible with the thing commanded to be done?\n",
      "If such a supposition would be unnatural and unreasonable, it cannot be\n",
      "rational to maintain that an injunction of the trial by jury in certain\n",
      "cases is an interdiction of it in others.\n",
      "\n",
      "A power to constitute courts is a power to prescribe the mode of trial;\n",
      "and consequently, if nothing was said in the Constitution on the subject\n",
      "of juries, the legislature would be at liberty either to adopt that\n",
      "institution or to let it alone. This discretion, in regard to criminal\n",
      "causes, is abridged by the express injunction of trial by jury in all\n",
      "such cases; but it is, of course, left at large in relation to civil\n",
      "causes, there being a total silence on this head. The specification of\n",
      "an obligation to try all criminal causes in a particular mode, excludes\n",
      "indeed the obligation or necessity of employing the same mode in civil\n",
      "causes, but does not abridge the power of the legislature to exercise\n",
      "that mode if it should be thought proper. The pretense, therefore, that\n",
      "the national legislature would not be at full liberty to submit all the\n",
      "civil causes of federal cognizance to the determination of juries, is a\n",
      "pretense destitute of all just foundation.\n",
      "\n",
      "From these observations this conclusion results: that the trial by jury\n",
      "in civil cases would not be abolished; and that the use attempted to\n",
      "be made of the maxims which have been quoted, is contrary to reason and\n",
      "common-sense, and therefore not admissible. Even if these maxims had a\n",
      "precise technical sense, corresponding with the idea of those who employ\n",
      "them upon the present occasion, which, however, is not the case, they\n",
      "would still be inapplicable to a constitution of government. In relation\n",
      "to such a subject, the natural and obvious sense of its provisions,\n",
      "apart from any technical rules, is the true criterion of construction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having now seen that the maxims relied upon will not bear the use made\n",
      "of them, let us endeavor to ascertain their proper use and true meaning.\n",
      "This will be best done by examples. The plan of the convention declares\n",
      "that the power of Congress, or, in other words, of the national\n",
      "legislature, shall extend to certain enumerated cases. This\n",
      "specification of particulars evidently excludes all pretension to a\n",
      "general legislative authority, because an affirmative grant of special\n",
      "powers would be absurd, as well as useless, if a general authority was\n",
      "intended.\n",
      "\n",
      "In like manner the judicial authority of the federal judicatures is\n",

      "beyond which the federal courts cannot extend their jurisdiction,\n",

      "Let us suppose that by the laws of this State a married woman was\n",

      "this as an evil, should enact that she might dispose of her property by\n",
      "deed executed in the presence of a magistrate. In such a case there can\n",
      "be no doubt but the specification would amount to an exclusion of any\n",
      "other mode of conveyance, because the woman having no previous power to\n",
      "alienate her property, the specification determines the particular mode\n",
      "which she is, for that purpose, to avail herself of. But let us further\n",
      "suppose that in a subsequent part of the same act it should be declared\n",
      "that no woman should dispose of any estate of a determinate value\n",
      "without the consent of three of her nearest relations, signified by\n",
      "their signing the deed; could it be inferred from this regulation that\n",
      "a married woman might not procure the approbation of her relations to\n",

      "criminal nature.\n",

      "From these observations it must appear unquestionably true, that trial\n",
      "by jury is in no case abolished by the proposed Constitution, and it is\n",
      "equally true, that in those controversies between individuals in\n",
      "which the great body of the people are likely to be interested, that\n",
      "institution will remain precisely in the same situation in which it is\n",
      "placed by the State constitutions, and will be in no degree altered\n",
      "or influenced by the adoption of the plan under consideration. The\n",
      "foundation of this assertion is, that the national judiciary will have\n",
      "no cognizance of them, and of course they will remain determinable as\n",
      "heretofore by the State courts only, and in the manner which the State\n",

      "controversies between the citizens of the same State, unless where they\n",
      "depend upon positive violations of the articles of union, by acts of the\n",
      "State legislatures, will belong exclusively to the jurisdiction of the\n",
      "State tribunals. Add to this, that admiralty causes, and almost all\n",
      "those which are of equity jurisdiction, are determinable under our own\n",
      "government without the intervention of a jury, and the inference from\n",
      "the whole will be, that this institution, as it exists with us at\n",
      "present, cannot possibly be affected to any great extent by the proposed\n",
      "alteration in our system of government.\n",

      "The friends and adversaries of the plan of the convention, if they agree\n",

      "the former regard it as a valuable safeguard to liberty; the latter\n",
      "represent it as the very palladium of free government. For my own\n",
      "part, the more the operation of the institution has fallen under my\n",
      "observation, the more reason I have discovered for holding it in high\n",
      "estimation; and it would be altogether superfluous to examine to\n",
      "what extent it deserves to be esteemed useful or essential in a\n",
      "representative republic, or how much more merit it may be entitled to,\n",
      "as a defense against the oppressions of an hereditary monarch, than as\n",
      "a barrier to the tyranny of popular magistrates in a popular government.\n",
      "Discussions of this kind would be more curious than beneficial, as all\n",
      "are satisfied of the utility of the institution, and of its friendly\n",
      "aspect to liberty. But I must acknowledge that I cannot readily discern\n",
      "the inseparable connection between the existence of liberty, and the\n",
      "trial by jury in civil cases. Arbitrary impeachments, arbitrary methods\n",
      "of prosecuting pretended offenses, and arbitrary punishments upon\n",
      "arbitrary convictions, have ever appeared to me to be the great\n",
      "engines of judicial despotism; and these have all relation to criminal\n",
      "proceedings. The trial by jury in criminal cases, aided by the habeas\n",
      "corpus act, seems therefore to be alone concerned in the question. And\n",
      "both of these are provided for, in the most ample manner, in the plan of\n",
      "the convention.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has been observed, that trial by jury is a safeguard against an\n",
      "oppressive exercise of the power of taxation. This observation deserves\n",
      "to be canvassed.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is evident that it can have no influence upon the legislature, in\n",
      "regard to the amount of taxes to be laid, to the objects upon which they\n",
      "are to be imposed, or to the rule by which they are to be apportioned.\n",
      "If it can have any influence, therefore, it must be upon the mode of\n",
      "collection, and the conduct of the officers intrusted with the execution\n",
      "of the revenue laws.\n",
      "\n",
      "As to the mode of collection in this State, under our own Constitution,\n",
      "the trial by jury is in most cases out of use. The taxes are usually\n",
      "levied by the more summary proceeding of distress and sale, as in cases\n",
      "of rent. And it is acknowledged on all hands, that this is essential to\n",
      "the efficacy of the revenue laws. The dilatory course of a trial at\n",
      "law to recover the taxes imposed on individuals, would neither suit the\n",
      "exigencies of the public nor promote the convenience of the citizens. It\n",
      "would often occasion an accumulation of costs, more burdensome than the\n",
      "original sum of the tax to be levied.\n",
      "\n",
      "And as to the conduct of the officers of the revenue, the provision in\n",
      "favor of trial by jury in criminal cases, will afford the security\n",
      "aimed at. Wilful abuses of a public authority, to the oppression of the\n",
      "subject, and every species of official extortion, are offenses against\n",
      "the government, for which the persons who commit them may be indicted\n",
      "and punished according to the circumstances of the case.\n",
      "\n",
      "The excellence of the trial by jury in civil cases appears to depend\n",
      "on circumstances foreign to the preservation of liberty. The strongest\n",
      "argument in its favor is, that it is a security against corruption.\n",
      "As there is always more time and better opportunity to tamper with a\n",
      "standing body of magistrates than with a jury summoned for the occasion,\n",
      "there is room to suppose that a corrupt influence would more easily\n",
      "find its way to the former than to the latter. The force of this\n",
      "consideration is, however, diminished by others. The sheriff, who is\n",
      "the summoner of ordinary juries, and the clerks of courts, who have the\n",
      "nomination of special juries, are themselves standing officers, and,\n",
      "acting individually, may be supposed more accessible to the touch\n",
      "of corruption than the judges, who are a collective body. It is not\n",
      "difficult to see, that it would be in the power of those officers to\n",
      "select jurors who would serve the purpose of the party as well as a\n",
      "corrupted bench. In the next place, it may fairly be supposed,\n",
      "that there would be less difficulty in gaining some of the jurors\n",
      "promiscuously taken from the public mass, than in gaining men who had\n",
      "been chosen by the government for their probity and good character. But\n",
      "making every deduction for these considerations, the trial by jury must\n",
      "still be a valuable check upon corruption. It greatly multiplies the\n",
      "impediments to its success. As matters now stand, it would be necessary\n",
      "to corrupt both court and jury; for where the jury have gone evidently\n",
      "wrong, the court will generally grant a new trial, and it would be in\n",
      "most cases of little use to practice upon the jury, unless the court\n",
      "could be likewise gained. Here then is a double security; and it will\n",
      "readily be perceived that this complicated agency tends to preserve the\n",
      "purity of both institutions. By increasing the obstacles to success, it\n",
      "discourages attempts to seduce the integrity of either. The temptations\n",
      "to prostitution which the judges might have to surmount, must certainly\n",
      "be much fewer, while the co-operation of a jury is necessary, than they\n",
      "might be, if they had themselves the exclusive determination of all\n",
      "causes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Notwithstanding, therefore, the doubts I have expressed, as to the\n",
      "essentiality of trial by jury in civil cases to liberty, I admit that\n",
      "it is in most cases, under proper regulations, an excellent method of\n",
      "determining questions of property; and that on this account alone it\n",
      "would be entitled to a constitutional provision in its favor if it were\n",
      "possible to fix the limits within which it ought to be comprehended.\n",
      "There is, however, in all cases, great difficulty in this; and men not\n",
      "blinded by enthusiasm must be sensible that in a federal government,\n",
      "which is a composition of societies whose ideas and institutions in\n",
      "relation to the matter materially vary from each other, that difficulty\n",
      "must be not a little augmented. For my own part, at every new view\n",
      "I take of the subject, I become more convinced of the reality of\n",
      "the obstacles which, we are authoritatively informed, prevented the\n",
      "insertion of a provision on this head in the plan of the convention.\n",
      "\n",
      "The great difference between the limits of the jury trial in different\n",
      "States is not generally understood; and as it must have considerable\n",
      "influence on the sentence we ought to pass upon the omission complained\n",
      "of in regard to this point, an explanation of it is necessary. In this\n",
      "State, our judicial establishments resemble, more nearly than in any\n",
      "other, those of Great Britain. We have courts of common law, courts\n",
      "of probates (analogous in certain matters to the spiritual courts in\n",
      "England), a court of admiralty and a court of chancery. In the courts\n",
      "of common law only, the trial by jury prevails, and this with some\n",
      "exceptions. In all the others a single judge presides, and proceeds\n",
      "in general either according to the course of the canon or civil law,\n",
      "without the aid of a jury.(1) In New Jersey, there is a court of\n",
      "chancery which proceeds like ours, but neither courts of admiralty nor\n",
      "of probates, in the sense in which these last are established with us.\n",
      "In that State the courts of common law have the cognizance of those\n",
      "causes which with us are determinable in the courts of admiralty and of\n",
      "probates, and of course the jury trial is more extensive in New Jersey\n",
      "than in New York. In Pennsylvania, this is perhaps still more the case,\n",
      "for there is no court of chancery in that State, and its common-law\n",
      "courts have equity jurisdiction. It has a court of admiralty, but\n",
      "none of probates, at least on the plan of ours. Delaware has in these\n",
      "respects imitated Pennsylvania. Maryland approaches more nearly to New\n",
      "York, as does also Virginia, except that the latter has a plurality of\n",
      "chancellors. North Carolina bears most affinity to Pennsylvania; South\n",
      "Carolina to Virginia. I believe, however, that in some of those States\n",
      "which have distinct courts of admiralty, the causes depending in them\n",
      "are triable by juries. In Georgia there are none but common-law courts,\n",
      "and an appeal of course lies from the verdict of one jury to another,\n",
      "which is called a special jury, and for which a particular mode of\n",
      "appointment is marked out. In Connecticut, they have no distinct courts\n",
      "either of chancery or of admiralty, and their courts of probates have no\n",
      "jurisdiction of causes. Their common-law courts have admiralty and, to\n",
      "a certain extent, equity jurisdiction. In cases of importance, their\n",
      "General Assembly is the only court of chancery. In Connecticut,\n",
      "therefore, the trial by jury extends in practice further than in\n",
      "any other State yet mentioned. Rhode Island is, I believe, in this\n",
      "particular, pretty much in the situation of Connecticut. Massachusetts\n",
      "and New Hampshire, in regard to the blending of law, equity, and\n",
      "admiralty jurisdictions, are in a similar predicament. In the four\n",
      "Eastern States, the trial by jury not only stands upon a broader\n",
      "foundation than in the other States, but it is attended with a\n",
      "peculiarity unknown, in its full extent, to any of them. There is an\n",
      "appeal of course from one jury to another, till there have been two\n",
      "verdicts out of three on one side.\n",
      "\n",
      "From this sketch it appears that there is a material diversity, as well\n",
      "in the modification as in the extent of the institution of trial by jury\n",
      "in civil cases, in the several States; and from this fact these obvious\n",
      "reflections flow: first, that no general rule could have been fixed upon\n",
      "by the convention which would have corresponded with the circumstances\n",
      "of all the States; and secondly, that more or at least as much might\n",
      "have been hazarded by taking the system of any one State for a standard,\n",
      "as by omitting a provision altogether and leaving the matter, as has\n",
      "been done, to legislative regulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The propositions which have been made for supplying the omission have\n",
      "rather served to illustrate than to obviate the difficulty of the thing.\n",
      "The minority of Pennsylvania have proposed this mode of expression for\n",
      "the purpose--\"Trial by jury shall be as heretofore\"--and this I maintain\n",
      "would be senseless and nugatory. The United States, in their united or\n",
      "collective capacity, are the OBJECT to which all general provisions\n",
      "in the Constitution must necessarily be construed to refer. Now it is\n",
      "evident that though trial by jury, with various limitations, is known\n",
      "in each State individually, yet in the United States, as such, it is at\n",
      "this time altogether unknown, because the present federal government\n",
      "has no judiciary power whatever; and consequently there is no proper\n",
      "antecedent or previous establishment to which the term heretofore\n",
      "could relate. It would therefore be destitute of a precise meaning, and\n",
      "inoperative from its uncertainty.\n",
      "\n",
      "As, on the one hand, the form of the provision would not fulfil the\n",
      "intent of its proposers, so, on the other, if I apprehend that intent\n",
      "rightly, it would be in itself inexpedient. I presume it to be, that\n",
      "causes in the federal courts should be tried by jury, if, in the State\n",
      "where the courts sat, that mode of trial would obtain in a similar case\n",
      "in the State courts; that is to say, admiralty causes should be tried in\n",
      "Connecticut by a jury, in New York without one. The capricious operation\n",
      "of so dissimilar a method of trial in the same cases, under the same\n",
      "government, is of itself sufficient to indispose every wellregulated\n",
      "judgment towards it. Whether the cause should be tried with or without\n",
      "a jury, would depend, in a great number of cases, on the accidental\n",
      "situation of the court and parties.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this is not, in my estimation, the greatest objection. I feel a deep\n",
      "and deliberate conviction that there are many cases in which the trial\n",
      "by jury is an ineligible one. I think it so particularly in cases which\n",
      "concern the public peace with foreign nations--that is, in most cases\n",
      "where the question turns wholly on the laws of nations. Of this nature,\n",
      "among others, are all prize causes. Juries cannot be supposed competent\n",
      "to investigations that require a thorough knowledge of the laws and\n",
      "usages of nations; and they will sometimes be under the influence of\n",
      "impressions which will not suffer them to pay sufficient regard to those\n",
      "considerations of public policy which ought to guide their inquiries.\n",
      "There would of course be always danger that the rights of other nations\n",
      "might be infringed by their decisions, so as to afford occasions of\n",
      "reprisal and war. Though the proper province of juries be to determine\n",
      "matters of fact, yet in most cases legal consequences are complicated\n",
      "with fact in such a manner as to render a separation impracticable.\n",
      "\n",
      "It will add great weight to this remark, in relation to prize causes, to\n",
      "mention that the method of determining them has been thought worthy of\n",
      "particular regulation in various treaties between different powers of\n",
      "Europe, and that, pursuant to such treaties, they are determinable in\n",
      "Great Britain, in the last resort, before the king himself, in his privy\n",
      "council, where the fact, as well as the law, undergoes a re-examination.\n",
      "This alone demonstrates the impolicy of inserting a fundamental\n",
      "provision in the Constitution which would make the State systems a\n",
      "standard for the national government in the article under consideration,\n",
      "and the danger of encumbering the government with any constitutional\n",
      "provisions the propriety of which is not indisputable.\n",
      "\n",
      "My convictions are equally strong that great advantages result from the\n",
      "separation of the equity from the law jurisdiction, and that the causes\n",
      "which belong to the former would be improperly committed to juries.\n",
      "The great and primary use of a court of equity is to give relief in\n",
      "extraordinary cases, which are exceptions(2) to general rules. To unite\n",
      "the jurisdiction of such cases with the ordinary jurisdiction, must have\n",
      "a tendency to unsettle the general rules, and to subject every case that\n",
      "arises to a special determination; while a separation of the one from\n",
      "the other has the contrary effect of rendering one a sentinel over the\n",
      "other, and of keeping each within the expedient limits. Besides this,\n",
      "the circumstances that constitute cases proper for courts of equity are\n",
      "in many instances so nice and intricate, that they are incompatible with\n",
      "the genius of trials by jury. They require often such long, deliberate,\n",
      "and critical investigation as would be impracticable to men called from\n",
      "their occupations, and obliged to decide before they were permitted\n",
      "to return to them. The simplicity and expedition which form the\n",
      "distinguishing characters of this mode of trial require that the matter\n",
      "to be decided should be reduced to some single and obvious point; while\n",
      "the litigations usual in chancery frequently comprehend a long train of\n",
      "minute and independent particulars.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is true that the separation of the equity from the legal jurisdiction\n",
      "is peculiar to the English system of jurisprudence: which is the model\n",
      "that has been followed in several of the States. But it is equally true\n",
      "that the trial by jury has been unknown in every case in which they have\n",
      "been united. And the separation is essential to the preservation of that\n",
      "institution in its pristine purity. The nature of a court of equity will\n",
      "readily permit the extension of its jurisdiction to matters of law;\n",
      "but it is not a little to be suspected, that the attempt to extend the\n",
      "jurisdiction of the courts of law to matters of equity will not only\n",
      "be unproductive of the advantages which may be derived from courts of\n",
      "chancery, on the plan upon which they are established in this State, but\n",
      "will tend gradually to change the nature of the courts of law, and to\n",
      "undermine the trial by jury, by introducing questions too complicated\n",
      "for a decision in that mode.\n",
      "\n",
      "These appeared to be conclusive reasons against incorporating the\n",
      "systems of all the States, in the formation of the national judiciary,\n",
      "according to what may be conjectured to have been the attempt of the\n",
      "Pennsylvania minority. Let us now examine how far the proposition of\n",
      "Massachusetts is calculated to remedy the supposed defect.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is in this form: \"In civil actions between citizens of different\n",
      "States, every issue of fact, arising in actions at common law, may be\n",
      "tried by a jury if the parties, or either of them request it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This, at best, is a proposition confined to one description of causes;\n",
      "and the inference is fair, either that the Massachusetts convention\n",
      "considered that as the only class of federal causes, in which the\n",
      "trial by jury would be proper; or that if desirous of a more extensive\n",
      "provision, they found it impracticable to devise one which would\n",
      "properly answer the end. If the first, the omission of a regulation\n",
      "respecting so partial an object can never be considered as a\n",
      "material imperfection in the system. If the last, it affords a strong\n",
      "corroboration of the extreme difficulty of the thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this is not all: if we advert to the observations already made\n",
      "respecting the courts that subsist in the several States of the Union,\n",
      "and the different powers exercised by them, it will appear that there\n",
      "are no expressions more vague and indeterminate than those which\n",
      "have been employed to characterize that species of causes which it\n",
      "is intended shall be entitled to a trial by jury. In this State, the\n",
      "boundaries between actions at common law and actions of equitable\n",
      "jurisdiction, are ascertained in conformity to the rules which prevail\n",
      "in England upon that subject. In many of the other States the boundaries\n",
      "are less precise. In some of them every cause is to be tried in a court\n",
      "of common law, and upon that foundation every action may be considered\n",
      "as an action at common law, to be determined by a jury, if the parties,\n",
      "or either of them, choose it. Hence the same irregularity and confusion\n",
      "would be introduced by a compliance with this proposition, that I\n",
      "have already noticed as resulting from the regulation proposed by\n",
      "the Pennsylvania minority. In one State a cause would receive its\n",
      "determination from a jury, if the parties, or either of them, requested\n",
      "it; but in another State, a cause exactly similar to the other, must\n",
      "be decided without the intervention of a jury, because the State\n",
      "judicatories varied as to common-law jurisdiction.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is obvious, therefore, that the Massachusetts proposition, upon this\n",
      "subject cannot operate as a general regulation, until some uniform plan,\n",
      "with respect to the limits of common-law and equitable jurisdictions,\n",
      "shall be adopted by the different States. To devise a plan of that kind\n",
      "is a task arduous in itself, and which it would require much time\n",
      "and reflection to mature. It would be extremely difficult, if not\n",
      "impossible, to suggest any general regulation that would be acceptable\n",
      "to all the States in the Union, or that would perfectly quadrate with\n",
      "the several State institutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "It may be asked, Why could not a reference have been made to the\n",
      "constitution of this State, taking that, which is allowed by me to be a\n",
      "good one, as a standard for the United States? I answer that it is not\n",
      "very probable the other States would entertain the same opinion of our\n",
      "institutions as we do ourselves. It is natural to suppose that they are\n",
      "hitherto more attached to their own, and that each would struggle for\n",
      "the preference. If the plan of taking one State as a model for the whole\n",
      "had been thought of in the convention, it is to be presumed that the\n",
      "adoption of it in that body would have been rendered difficult by the\n",
      "predilection of each representation in favor of its own government; and\n",
      "it must be uncertain which of the States would have been taken as the\n",
      "model. It has been shown that many of them would be improper ones. And\n",
      "I leave it to conjecture, whether, under all circumstances, it is most\n",
      "likely that New York, or some other State, would have been preferred.\n",
      "But admit that a judicious selection could have been effected in the\n",
      "convention, still there would have been great danger of jealousy and\n",
      "disgust in the other States, at the partiality which had been shown\n",
      "to the institutions of one. The enemies of the plan would have been\n",
      "furnished with a fine pretext for raising a host of local prejudices\n",
      "against it, which perhaps might have hazarded, in no inconsiderable\n",
      "degree, its final establishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "To avoid the embarrassments of a definition of the cases which the\n",
      "trial by jury ought to embrace, it is sometimes suggested by men of\n",
      "enthusiastic tempers, that a provision might have been inserted\n",
      "for establishing it in all cases whatsoever. For this I believe,\n",
      "no precedent is to be found in any member of the Union; and the\n",
      "considerations which have been stated in discussing the proposition of\n",
      "the minority of Pennsylvania, must satisfy every sober mind that the\n",
      "establishment of the trial by jury in all cases would have been an\n",
      "unpardonable error in the plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "In short, the more it is considered the more arduous will appear the\n",
      "task of fashioning a provision in such a form as not to express too\n",
      "little to answer the purpose, or too much to be advisable; or which\n",
      "might not have opened other sources of opposition to the great and\n",
      "essential object of introducing a firm national government.\n",

      "I cannot but persuade myself, on the other hand, that the different\n",
      "lights in which the subject has been placed in the course of these\n",
      "observations, will go far towards removing in candid minds the\n",
      "apprehensions they may have entertained on the point. They have tended\n",
      "to show that the security of liberty is materially concerned only in the\n",
      "trial by jury in criminal cases, which is provided for in the most ample\n",
      "manner in the plan of the convention; that even in far the greatest\n",
      "proportion of civil cases, and those in which the great body of the\n",
      "community is interested, that mode of trial will remain in its full\n",
      "force, as established in the State constitutions, untouched and\n",
      "unaffected by the plan of the convention; that it is in no\n",
      "case abolished(3) by that plan; and that there are great if not\n",
      "insurmountable difficulties in the way of making any precise and proper\n",
      "provision for it in a Constitution for the United States.\n",
      "\n",
      "The best judges of the matter will be the least anxious for a\n",
      "constitutional establishment of the trial by jury in civil cases, and\n",
      "will be the most ready to admit that the changes which are continually\n",
      "happening in the affairs of society may render a different mode of\n",
      "determining questions of property preferable in many cases in which\n",
      "that mode of trial now prevails. For my part, I acknowledge myself to be\n",
      "convinced that even in this State it might be advantageously extended\n",
      "to some cases to which it does not at present apply, and might as\n",
      "advantageously be abridged in others. It is conceded by all reasonable\n",
      "men that it ought not to obtain in all cases. The examples of\n",
      "innovations which contract its ancient limits, as well in these States\n",
      "as in Great Britain, afford a strong presumption that its former extent\n",
      "has been found inconvenient, and give room to suppose that future\n",
      "experience may discover the propriety and utility of other exceptions.\n",
      "I suspect it to be impossible in the nature of the thing to fix the\n",
      "salutary point at which the operation of the institution ought to stop,\n",

      "it is equally so in the State of Connecticut; and yet it may be safely\n",
      "affirmed that more numerous encroachments have been made upon the trial\n",
      "by jury in this State since the Revolution, though provided for by a\n",
      "positive article of our constitution, than has happened in the same\n",
      "time either in Connecticut or Great Britain. It may be added that these\n",
      "encroachments have generally originated with the men who endeavor to\n",
      "persuade the people they are the warmest defenders of popular liberty,\n",
      "but who have rarely suffered constitutional obstacles to arrest them in\n",
      "a favorite career. The truth is that the general GENIUS of a government\n",
      "is all that can be substantially relied upon for permanent effects.\n",
      "Particular provisions, though not altogether useless, have far less\n",
      "virtue and efficacy than are commonly ascribed to them; and the want of\n",

      "it in civil also; while it is a notorious fact that Connecticut, which\n",

      "To the People of the State of New York:\n",
      "\n",
      "IN THE course of the foregoing review of the Constitution, I have taken\n",
      "notice of, and endeavored to answer most of the objections which have\n",
      "appeared against it. There, however, remain a few which either did not\n",
      "fall naturally under any particular head or were forgotten in their\n",
      "proper places. These shall now be discussed; but as the subject has been\n",
      "drawn into great length, I shall so far consult brevity as to comprise\n",
      "all my observations on these miscellaneous points in a single paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most considerable of the remaining objections is that the plan of\n",
      "the convention contains no bill of rights. Among other answers given\n",
      "to this, it has been upon different occasions remarked that the\n",
      "constitutions of several of the States are in a similar predicament.\n",
      "I add that New York is of the number. And yet the opposers of the new\n",
      "system, in this State, who profess an unlimited admiration for its\n",
      "constitution, are among the most intemperate partisans of a bill of\n",
      "rights. To justify their zeal in this matter, they allege two things:\n",
      "one is that, though the constitution of New York has no bill of rights\n",
      "prefixed to it, yet it contains, in the body of it, various provisions\n",
      "in favor of particular privileges and rights, which, in substance amount\n",
      "to the same thing; the other is, that the Constitution adopts, in their\n",
      "full extent, the common and statute law of Great Britain, by which many\n",
      "other rights, not expressed in it, are equally secured.\n",
      "\n",
      "To the first I answer, that the Constitution proposed by the convention\n",
      "contains, as well as the constitution of this State, a number of such\n",
      "provisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Independent of those which relate to the structure of the government, we\n",
      "find the following: Article 1, section 3, clause 7--\"Judgment in cases\n",
      "of impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from office, and\n",
      "disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit\n",
      "under the United States; but the party convicted shall, nevertheless,\n",
      "be liable and subject to indictment, trial, judgment, and punishment\n",
      "according to law.\" Section 9, of the same article, clause 2--\"The\n",
      "privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless\n",
      "when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require\n",
      "it.\" Clause 3--\"No bill of attainder or ex-post-facto law shall be\n",
      "passed.\" Clause 7--\"No title of nobility shall be granted by the United\n",
      "States; and no person holding any office of profit or trust under them,\n",
      "shall, without the consent of the Congress, accept of any present,\n",
      "emolument, office, or title of any kind whatever, from any king, prince,\n",
      "or foreign state.\" Article 3, section 2, clause 3--\"The trial of all\n",
      "crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be by jury; and such\n",
      "trial shall be held in the State where the said crimes shall have been\n",
      "committed; but when not committed within any State, the trial shall\n",
      "be at such place or places as the Congress may by law have directed.\"\n",
      "Section 3, of the same article--\"Treason against the United States\n",
      "shall consist only in levying war against them, or in adhering to their\n",
      "enemies, giving them aid and comfort. No person shall be convicted of\n",
      "treason, unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act,\n",
      "or on confession in open court.\" And clause 3, of the same section--\"The\n",
      "Congress shall have power to declare the punishment of treason; but\n",
      "no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood, or forfeiture,\n",
      "except during the life of the person attainted.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It may well be a question, whether these are not, upon the whole, of\n",
      "equal importance with any which are to be found in the constitution\n",
      "of this State. The establishment of the writ of habeas corpus, the\n",
      "prohibition of ex post facto laws, and of TITLES OF NOBILITY, to which\n",
      "we have no corresponding provision in our Constitution, are perhaps\n",
      "greater securities to liberty and republicanism than any it contains.\n",
      "The creation of crimes after the commission of the fact, or, in other\n",
      "words, the subjecting of men to punishment for things which, when\n",
      "they were done, were breaches of no law, and the practice of arbitrary\n",
      "imprisonments, have been, in all ages, the favorite and most formidable\n",
      "instruments of tyranny. The observations of the judicious Blackstone,(1)\n",
      "in reference to the latter, are well worthy of recital: \"To bereave a\n",
      "man of life, (says he) or by violence to confiscate his estate,\n",
      "without accusation or trial, would be so gross and notorious an act of\n",
      "despotism, as must at once convey the alarm of tyranny throughout the\n",
      "whole nation; but confinement of the person, by secretly hurrying him to\n",
      "jail, where his sufferings are unknown or forgotten, is a less public,\n",
      "a less striking, and therefore a more dangerous engine of arbitrary\n",
      "government.\" And as a remedy for this fatal evil he is everywhere\n",
      "peculiarly emphatical in his encomiums on the habeas corpus act, which\n",
      "in one place he calls \"the BULWARK of the British Constitution.\"(2)\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing need be said to illustrate the importance of the prohibition of\n",
      "titles of nobility. This may truly be denominated the corner-stone of\n",
      "republican government; for so long as they are excluded, there can never\n",
      "be serious danger that the government will be any other than that of the\n",
      "people.\n",
      "\n",
      "To the second that is, to the pretended establishment of the common and\n",
      "state law by the Constitution, I answer, that they are expressly made\n",
      "subject \"to such alterations and provisions as the legislature shall\n",
      "from time to time make concerning the same.\" They are therefore at any\n",
      "moment liable to repeal by the ordinary legislative power, and of course\n",
      "have no constitutional sanction. The only use of the declaration was\n",
      "to recognize the ancient law and to remove doubts which might have been\n",
      "occasioned by the Revolution. This consequently can be considered as no\n",
      "part of a declaration of rights, which under our constitutions must be\n",
      "intended as limitations of the power of the government itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has been several times truly remarked that bills of rights are,\n",
      "in their origin, stipulations between kings and their subjects,\n",
      "abridgements of prerogative in favor of privilege, reservations of\n",
      "rights not surrendered to the prince. Such was MAGNA CHARTA, obtained\n",
      "by the barons, sword in hand, from King John. Such were the subsequent\n",
      "confirmations of that charter by succeeding princes. Such was the\n",
      "Petition of Right assented to by Charles I., in the beginning of his\n",
      "reign. Such, also, was the Declaration of Right presented by the Lords\n",
      "and Commons to the Prince of Orange in 1688, and afterwards thrown\n",
      "into the form of an act of parliament called the Bill of Rights. It is\n",
      "evident, therefore, that, according to their primitive signification,\n",
      "they have no application to constitutions professedly founded upon the\n",
      "power of the people, and executed by their immediate representatives and\n",
      "servants. Here, in strictness, the people surrender nothing; and as they\n",
      "retain every thing they have no need of particular reservations. \"WE,\n",
      "THE PEOPLE of the United States, to secure the blessings of liberty to\n",
      "ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution\n",
      "for the United States of America.\" Here is a better recognition of\n",
      "popular rights, than volumes of those aphorisms which make the principal\n",
      "figure in several of our State bills of rights, and which would\n",
      "sound much better in a treatise of ethics than in a constitution of\n",
      "government.\n",
      "\n",
      "But a minute detail of particular rights is certainly far less\n",
      "applicable to a Constitution like that under consideration, which is\n",
      "merely intended to regulate the general political interests of the\n",
      "nation, than to a constitution which has the regulation of every species\n",
      "of personal and private concerns. If, therefore, the loud clamors\n",
      "against the plan of the convention, on this score, are well founded, no\n",
      "epithets of reprobation will be too strong for the constitution of\n",
      "this State. But the truth is, that both of them contain all which, in\n",
      "relation to their objects, is reasonably to be desired.\n",
      "\n",
      "I go further, and affirm that bills of rights, in the sense and to the\n",
      "extent in which they are contended for, are not only unnecessary in the\n",
      "proposed Constitution, but would even be dangerous. They would contain\n",
      "various exceptions to powers not granted; and, on this very account,\n",
      "would afford a colorable pretext to claim more than were granted. For\n",
      "why declare that things shall not be done which there is no power to do?\n",
      "Why, for instance, should it be said that the liberty of the press shall\n",
      "not be restrained, when no power is given by which restrictions may\n",
      "be imposed? I will not contend that such a provision would confer\n",
      "a regulating power; but it is evident that it would furnish, to men\n",
      "disposed to usurp, a plausible pretense for claiming that power. They\n",
      "might urge with a semblance of reason, that the Constitution ought not\n",
      "to be charged with the absurdity of providing against the abuse of\n",
      "an authority which was not given, and that the provision against\n",
      "restraining the liberty of the press afforded a clear implication, that\n",
      "a power to prescribe proper regulations concerning it was intended to be\n",
      "vested in the national government. This may serve as a specimen of the\n",
      "numerous handles which would be given to the doctrine of constructive\n",
      "powers, by the indulgence of an injudicious zeal for bills of rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the subject of the liberty of the press, as much as has been said,\n",
      "I cannot forbear adding a remark or two: in the first place, I observe,\n",
      "that there is not a syllable concerning it in the constitution of this\n",
      "State; in the next, I contend, that whatever has been said about it\n",
      "in that of any other State, amounts to nothing. What signifies a\n",
      "declaration, that \"the liberty of the press shall be inviolably\n",
      "preserved\"? What is the liberty of the press? Who can give it any\n",
      "definition which would not leave the utmost latitude for evasion? I\n",
      "hold it to be impracticable; and from this I infer, that its security,\n",
      "whatever fine declarations may be inserted in any constitution\n",
      "respecting it, must altogether depend on public opinion, and on the\n",
      "general spirit of the people and of the government.(3) And here, after\n",
      "all, as is intimated upon another occasion, must we seek for the only\n",
      "solid basis of all our rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "There remains but one other view of this matter to conclude the point.\n",
      "The truth is, after all the declamations we have heard, that the\n",
      "Constitution is itself, in every rational sense, and to every useful\n",
      "purpose, A BILL OF RIGHTS. The several bills of rights in Great Britain\n",
      "form its Constitution, and conversely the constitution of each State is\n",
      "its bill of rights. And the proposed Constitution, if adopted, will be\n",
      "the bill of rights of the Union. Is it one object of a bill of rights\n",
      "to declare and specify the political privileges of the citizens in the\n",
      "structure and administration of the government? This is done in the most\n",
      "ample and precise manner in the plan of the convention; comprehending\n",
      "various precautions for the public security, which are not to be found\n",
      "in any of the State constitutions. Is another object of a bill of rights\n",
      "to define certain immunities and modes of proceeding, which are relative\n",
      "to personal and private concerns? This we have seen has also been\n",
      "attended to, in a variety of cases, in the same plan. Adverting\n",
      "therefore to the substantial meaning of a bill of rights, it is absurd\n",
      "to allege that it is not to be found in the work of the convention. It\n",
      "may be said that it does not go far enough, though it will not be easy\n",
      "to make this appear; but it can with no propriety be contended that\n",
      "there is no such thing. It certainly must be immaterial what mode is\n",
      "observed as to the order of declaring the rights of the citizens, if\n",
      "they are to be found in any part of the instrument which establishes the\n",
      "government. And hence it must be apparent, that much of what has been\n",
      "said on this subject rests merely on verbal and nominal distinctions,\n",
      "entirely foreign from the substance of the thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another objection which has been made, and which, from the frequency of\n",
      "its repetition, it is to be presumed is relied on, is of this nature:\n",
      "\"It is improper (say the objectors) to confer such large powers, as\n",
      "are proposed, upon the national government, because the seat of that\n",
      "government must of necessity be too remote from many of the States\n",
      "to admit of a proper knowledge on the part of the constituent, of the\n",
      "conduct of the representative body.\" This argument, if it proves any\n",
      "thing, proves that there ought to be no general government whatever. For\n",
      "the powers which, it seems to be agreed on all hands, ought to be vested\n",
      "in the Union, cannot be safely intrusted to a body which is not under\n",
      "every requisite control. But there are satisfactory reasons to show that\n",
      "the objection is in reality not well founded. There is in most of\n",
      "the arguments which relate to distance a palpable illusion of the\n",
      "imagination. What are the sources of information by which the people in\n",
      "Montgomery County must regulate their judgment of the conduct of their\n",
      "representatives in the State legislature? Of personal observation they\n",
      "can have no benefit. This is confined to the citizens on the spot. They\n",
      "must therefore depend on the information of intelligent men, in whom\n",
      "they confide; and how must these men obtain their information? Evidently\n",
      "from the complexion of public measures, from the public prints, from\n",
      "correspondences with their representatives, and with other persons who\n",
      "reside at the place of their deliberations. This does not apply to\n",
      "Montgomery County only, but to all the counties at any considerable\n",
      "distance from the seat of government.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is equally evident that the same sources of information would be open\n",
      "to the people in relation to the conduct of their representatives in the\n",
      "general government, and the impediments to a prompt communication which\n",
      "distance may be supposed to create, will be overbalanced by the effects\n",
      "of the vigilance of the State governments. The executive and legislative\n",
      "bodies of each State will be so many sentinels over the persons employed\n",
      "in every department of the national administration; and as it will be\n",
      "in their power to adopt and pursue a regular and effectual system of\n",
      "intelligence, they can never be at a loss to know the behavior of those\n",
      "who represent their constituents in the national councils, and can\n",
      "readily communicate the same knowledge to the people. Their disposition\n",
      "to apprise the community of whatever may prejudice its interests from\n",
      "another quarter, may be relied upon, if it were only from the rivalship\n",
      "of power. And we may conclude with the fullest assurance that the\n",
      "people, through that channel, will be better informed of the conduct of\n",
      "their national representatives, than they can be by any means they now\n",
      "possess of that of their State representatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "It ought also to be remembered that the citizens who inhabit the country\n",
      "at and near the seat of government will, in all questions that affect\n",
      "the general liberty and prosperity, have the same interest with those\n",
      "who are at a distance, and that they will stand ready to sound the alarm\n",
      "when necessary, and to point out the actors in any pernicious project.\n",
      "The public papers will be expeditious messengers of intelligence to the\n",
      "most remote inhabitants of the Union.\n",

      "Among the many curious objections which have appeared against the\n",
      "proposed Constitution, the most extraordinary and the least colorable is\n",
      "derived from the want of some provision respecting the debts due to the\n",
      "United States. This has been represented as a tacit relinquishment of\n",
      "those debts, and as a wicked contrivance to screen public defaulters.\n",

      "void of foundation, the offspring of extreme ignorance or extreme\n",
      "dishonesty. In addition to the remarks I have made upon the subject in\n",
      "another place, I shall only observe that as it is a plain dictate of\n",
      "common-sense, so it is also an established doctrine of political law,\n",

      "The last objection of any consequence, which I at present recollect,\n",
      "turns upon the article of expense. If it were even true, that the\n",
      "adoption of the proposed government would occasion a considerable\n",
      "increase of expense, it would be an objection that ought to have no\n",
      "weight against the plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "The great bulk of the citizens of America are with reason convinced,\n",
      "that Union is the basis of their political happiness. Men of sense of\n",
      "all parties now, with few exceptions, agree that it cannot be preserved\n",
      "under the present system, nor without radical alterations; that new\n",
      "and extensive powers ought to be granted to the national head, and that\n",
      "these require a different organization of the federal government--a\n",
      "single body being an unsafe depositary of such ample authorities. In\n",
      "conceding all this, the question of expense must be given up; for it\n",
      "is impossible, with any degree of safety, to narrow the foundation upon\n",
      "which the system is to stand. The two branches of the legislature are,\n",
      "in the first instance, to consist of only sixty-five persons, which is\n",
      "the same number of which Congress, under the existing Confederation, may\n",
      "be composed. It is true that this number is intended to be increased;\n",
      "but this is to keep pace with the progress of the population and\n",
      "resources of the country. It is evident that a less number would, even\n",
      "in the first instance, have been unsafe, and that a continuance of the\n",
      "present number would, in a more advanced stage of population, be a very\n",
      "inadequate representation of the people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whence is the dreaded augmentation of expense to spring? One source\n",
      "indicated, is the multiplication of offices under the new government.\n",
      "Let us examine this a little.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is evident that the principal departments of the administration under\n",
      "the present government, are the same which will be required under the\n",
      "new. There are now a Secretary of War, a Secretary of Foreign Affairs, a\n",
      "Secretary for Domestic Affairs, a Board of Treasury, consisting of\n",
      "three persons, a Treasurer, assistants, clerks, etc. These officers are\n",
      "indispensable under any system, and will suffice under the new as well\n",
      "as the old. As to ambassadors and other ministers and agents in foreign\n",
      "countries, the proposed Constitution can make no other difference than\n",
      "to render their characters, where they reside, more respectable,\n",
      "and their services more useful. As to persons to be employed in the\n",
      "collection of the revenues, it is unquestionably true that these will\n",
      "form a very considerable addition to the number of federal officers;\n",
      "but it will not follow that this will occasion an increase of public\n",
      "expense. It will be in most cases nothing more than an exchange of State\n",
      "for national officers. In the collection of all duties, for instance,\n",
      "the persons employed will be wholly of the latter description. The\n",
      "States individually will stand in no need of any for this purpose.\n",
      "What difference can it make in point of expense to pay officers of the\n",
      "customs appointed by the State or by the United States? There is no good\n",
      "reason to suppose that either the number or the salaries of the latter\n",
      "will be greater than those of the former.\n",
      "\n",
      "Where then are we to seek for those additional articles of expense which\n",
      "are to swell the account to the enormous size that has been represented\n",
      "to us? The chief item which occurs to me respects the support of the\n",
      "judges of the United States. I do not add the President, because there\n",
      "is now a president of Congress, whose expenses may not be far, if any\n",
      "thing, short of those which will be incurred on account of the President\n",
      "of the United States. The support of the judges will clearly be an extra\n",
      "expense, but to what extent will depend on the particular plan which may\n",
      "be adopted in regard to this matter. But upon no reasonable plan can it\n",
      "amount to a sum which will be an object of material consequence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us now see what there is to counterbalance any extra expense that\n",
      "may attend the establishment of the proposed government. The first thing\n",
      "which presents itself is that a great part of the business which now\n",
      "keeps Congress sitting through the year will be transacted by the\n",
      "President. Even the management of foreign negotiations will naturally\n",
      "devolve upon him, according to general principles concerted with the\n",
      "Senate, and subject to their final concurrence. Hence it is evident that\n",
      "a portion of the year will suffice for the session of both the Senate\n",
      "and the House of Representatives; we may suppose about a fourth for the\n",
      "latter and a third, or perhaps half, for the former. The extra business\n",
      "of treaties and appointments may give this extra occupation to the\n",
      "Senate. From this circumstance we may infer that, until the House of\n",
      "Representatives shall be increased greatly beyond its present number,\n",
      "there will be a considerable saving of expense from the difference\n",
      "between the constant session of the present and the temporary session of\n",
      "the future Congress.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there is another circumstance of great importance in the view of\n",
      "economy. The business of the United States has hitherto occupied\n",
      "the State legislatures, as well as Congress. The latter has made\n",
      "requisitions which the former have had to provide for. Hence it\n",
      "has happened that the sessions of the State legislatures have been\n",
      "protracted greatly beyond what was necessary for the execution of the\n",
      "mere local business of the States. More than half their time has been\n",
      "frequently employed in matters which related to the United States. Now\n",
      "the members who compose the legislatures of the several States amount to\n",
      "two thousand and upwards, which number has hitherto performed what under\n",
      "the new system will be done in the first instance by sixty-five persons,\n",
      "and probably at no future period by above a fourth or fifth of that\n",
      "number. The Congress under the proposed government will do all the\n",
      "business of the United States themselves, without the intervention of\n",
      "the State legislatures, who thenceforth will have only to attend to\n",
      "the affairs of their particular States, and will not have to sit in any\n",
      "proportion as long as they have heretofore done. This difference in the\n",
      "time of the sessions of the State legislatures will be clear gain,\n",
      "and will alone form an article of saving, which may be regarded as an\n",
      "equivalent for any additional objects of expense that may be occasioned\n",
      "by the adoption of the new system.\n",
      "\n",
      "The result from these observations is that the sources of additional\n",
      "expense from the establishment of the proposed Constitution are much\n",
      "fewer than may have been imagined; that they are counterbalanced by\n",
      "considerable objects of saving; and that while it is questionable on\n",
      "which side the scale will preponderate, it is certain that a government\n",
      "less expensive would be incompetent to the purposes of the Union.\n",

      "ACCORDING to the formal division of the subject of these papers,\n",
      "announced in my first number, there would appear still to remain for\n",
      "discussion two points: \"the analogy of the proposed government to your\n",
      "own State constitution,\" and \"the additional security which its adoption\n",
      "will afford to republican government, to liberty, and to property.\" But\n",
      "these heads have been so fully anticipated and exhausted in the progress\n",
      "of the work, that it would now scarcely be possible to do any thing\n",
      "more than repeat, in a more dilated form, what has been heretofore said,\n",
      "which the advanced stage of the question, and the time already spent\n",
      "upon it, conspire to forbid.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is remarkable, that the resemblance of the plan of the convention\n",
      "to the act which organizes the government of this State holds, not\n",
      "less with regard to many of the supposed defects, than to the real\n",
      "excellences of the former. Among the pretended defects are the\n",
      "re-eligibility of the Executive, the want of a council, the omission\n",
      "of a formal bill of rights, the omission of a provision respecting the\n",
      "liberty of the press. These and several others which have been noted\n",
      "in the course of our inquiries are as much chargeable on the existing\n",
      "constitution of this State, as on the one proposed for the Union; and\n",
      "a man must have slender pretensions to consistency, who can rail at the\n",
      "latter for imperfections which he finds no difficulty in excusing in the\n",
      "former. Nor indeed can there be a better proof of the insincerity\n",
      "and affectation of some of the zealous adversaries of the plan of the\n",

      "attacked that plan, for matters in regard to which our own constitution\n",
      "is equally or perhaps more vulnerable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The additional securities to republican government, to liberty and\n",
      "to property, to be derived from the adoption of the plan under\n",
      "consideration, consist chiefly in the restraints which the preservation\n",
      "of the Union will impose on local factions and insurrections, and on\n",
      "the ambition of powerful individuals in single States, who may acquire\n",
      "credit and influence enough, from leaders and favorites, to become the\n",
      "despots of the people; in the diminution of the opportunities to foreign\n",
      "intrigue, which the dissolution of the Confederacy would invite and\n",
      "facilitate; in the prevention of extensive military establishments,\n",
      "which could not fail to grow out of wars between the States in a\n",
      "disunited situation; in the express guaranty of a republican form of\n",
      "government to each; in the absolute and universal exclusion of titles\n",
      "of nobility; and in the precautions against the repetition of those\n",
      "practices on the part of the State governments which have undermined the\n",
      "foundations of property and credit, have planted mutual distrust in\n",
      "the breasts of all classes of citizens, and have occasioned an almost\n",
      "universal prostration of morals.\n",

      "Thus have I, fellow-citizens, executed the task I had assigned to\n",
      "myself; with what success, your conduct must determine. I trust at\n",

      "respecting the spirit with which my endeavors should be conducted. I\n",
      "have addressed myself purely to your judgments, and have studiously\n",
      "avoided those asperities which are too apt to disgrace political\n",

      "by the language and conduct of the opponents of the Constitution. The\n",
      "charge of a conspiracy against the liberties of the people, which has\n",
      "been indiscriminately brought against the advocates of the plan,\n",
      "has something in it too wanton and too malignant, not to excite the\n",
      "indignation of every man who feels in his own bosom a refutation of the\n",
      "calumny. The perpetual changes which have been rung upon the wealthy,\n",
      "the well-born, and the great, have been such as to inspire the\n",
      "disgust of all sensible men. And the unwarrantable concealments and\n",
      "misrepresentations which have been in various ways practiced to keep\n",
      "the truth from the public eye, have been of a nature to demand\n",
      "the reprobation of all honest men. It is not impossible that these\n",

      "passion or prejudice, will justify to himself, to his country, or to his\n",
      "posterity, an improper election of the part he is to act. Let him beware\n",
      "of an obstinate adherence to party; let him reflect that the object upon\n",
      "which he is to decide is not a particular interest of the community, but\n",
      "the very existence of the nation; and let him remember that a majority\n",

      "Concessions on the part of the friends of the plan, that it has not a\n",
      "claim to absolute perfection, have afforded matter of no small triumph\n",
      "to its enemies. \"Why,\" say they, \"should we adopt an imperfect\n",
      "thing? Why not amend it and make it perfect before it is irrevocably\n",
      "established?\" This may be plausible enough, but it is only plausible. In\n",
      "the first place I remark, that the extent of these concessions has been\n",
      "greatly exaggerated. They have been stated as amounting to an admission\n",
      "that the plan is radically defective, and that without material\n",
      "alterations the rights and the interests of the community cannot be\n",
      "safely confided to it. This, as far as I have understood the meaning of\n",
      "those who make the concessions, is an entire perversion of their sense.\n",
      "No advocate of the measure can be found, who will not declare as his\n",
      "sentiment, that the system, though it may not be perfect in every part,\n",
      "is, upon the whole, a good one; is the best that the present views and\n",
      "circumstances of the country will permit; and is such an one as promises\n",
      "every species of security which a reasonable people can desire.\n",
      "\n",
      "I answer in the next place, that I should esteem it the extreme of\n",
      "imprudence to prolong the precarious state of our national affairs, and\n",
      "to expose the Union to the jeopardy of successive experiments, in the\n",
      "chimerical pursuit of a perfect plan. I never expect to see a perfect\n",
      "work from imperfect man. The result of the deliberations of all\n",
      "collective bodies must necessarily be a compound, as well of the errors\n",
      "and prejudices, as of the good sense and wisdom, of the individuals\n",
      "of whom they are composed. The compacts which are to embrace thirteen\n",
      "distinct States in a common bond of amity and union, must as necessarily\n",
      "be a compromise of as many dissimilar interests and inclinations. How\n",
      "can perfection spring from such materials?\n",
      "\n",
      "The reasons assigned in an excellent little pamphlet lately published\n",
      "in this city,(1) are unanswerable to show the utter improbability\n",
      "of assembling a new convention, under circumstances in any degree so\n",
      "favorable to a happy issue, as those in which the late convention met,\n",
      "deliberated, and concluded. I will not repeat the arguments there used,\n",
      "as I presume the production itself has had an extensive circulation.\n",
      "It is certainly well worthy the perusal of every friend to his country.\n",
      "There is, however, one point of light in which the subject of amendments\n",
      "still remains to be considered, and in which it has not yet been\n",
      "exhibited to public view. I cannot resolve to conclude without first\n",
      "taking a survey of it in this aspect.\n",
      "\n",
      "It appears to me susceptible of absolute demonstration, that it will\n",
      "be far more easy to obtain subsequent than previous amendments to the\n",
      "Constitution. The moment an alteration is made in the present plan, it\n",
      "becomes, to the purpose of adoption, a new one, and must undergo a new\n",
      "decision of each State. To its complete establishment throughout the\n",
      "Union, it will therefore require the concurrence of thirteen States. If,\n",
      "on the contrary, the Constitution proposed should once be ratified\n",
      "by all the States as it stands, alterations in it may at any time be\n",
      "effected by nine States. Here, then, the chances are as thirteen to\n",
      "nine(2) in favor of subsequent amendment, rather than of the original\n",
      "adoption of an entire system.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is not all. Every Constitution for the United States must\n",
      "inevitably consist of a great variety of particulars, in which thirteen\n",
      "independent States are to be accommodated in their interests or opinions\n",
      "of interest. We may of course expect to see, in any body of men charged\n",
      "with its original formation, very different combinations of the\n",
      "parts upon different points. Many of those who form a majority on\n",
      "one question, may become the minority on a second, and an association\n",
      "dissimilar to either may constitute the majority on a third. Hence the\n",
      "necessity of moulding and arranging all the particulars which are to\n",
      "compose the whole, in such a manner as to satisfy all the parties to the\n",
      "compact; and hence, also, an immense multiplication of difficulties and\n",
      "casualties in obtaining the collective assent to a final act. The degree\n",
      "of that multiplication must evidently be in a ratio to the number of\n",
      "particulars and the number of parties.\n",
      "\n",
      "But every amendment to the Constitution, if once established, would be\n",
      "a single proposition, and might be brought forward singly. There would\n",
      "then be no necessity for management or compromise, in relation to any\n",
      "other point--no giving nor taking. The will of the requisite number\n",
      "would at once bring the matter to a decisive issue. And consequently,\n",
      "whenever nine, or rather ten States, were united in the desire of a\n",
      "particular amendment, that amendment must infallibly take place. There\n",
      "can, therefore, be no comparison between the facility of affecting an\n",
      "amendment, and that of establishing in the first instance a complete\n",
      "Constitution.\n",
      "\n",
      "In opposition to the probability of subsequent amendments, it has been\n",
      "urged that the persons delegated to the administration of the national\n",
      "government will always be disinclined to yield up any portion of\n",
      "the authority of which they were once possessed. For my own part I\n",
      "acknowledge a thorough conviction that any amendments which may, upon\n",
      "mature consideration, be thought useful, will be applicable to the\n",
      "organization of the government, not to the mass of its powers; and on\n",
      "this account alone, I think there is no weight in the observation just\n",
      "stated. I also think there is little weight in it on another account.\n",
      "The intrinsic difficulty of governing THIRTEEN STATES at any rate,\n",
      "independent of calculations upon an ordinary degree of public spirit and\n",
      "integrity, will, in my opinion constantly impose on the national\n",
      "rulers the necessity of a spirit of accommodation to the reasonable\n",
      "expectations of their constituents. But there is yet a further\n",
      "consideration, which proves beyond the possibility of a doubt, that the\n",
      "observation is futile. It is this that the national rulers, whenever\n",
      "nine States concur, will have no option upon the subject. By the fifth\n",
      "article of the plan, the Congress will be obliged \"on the application of\n",
