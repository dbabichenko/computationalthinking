<body>
	<p>
	Link to an external site - note that you must use full URLs, including the protocol (http or https)
	</p>
	<a href="http://www.google.com">Link to Google search page</a>
	<xmp><a href="http://www.google.com">Link to Google search page</a></xmp>
	<a href="https://www.facebook.com/index.php">Link to Facebook home page</a>
	<xmp><a href="https://www.facebook.com/index.php">Link to Facebook home page</a></xmp>
	
	<hr />
	
	
	<p>
	Most web servers (Apache, IIS, Glassfish) assume that the starting page for your web application 
	is called "index.html" (or "index.php", or "index.whateverextension").  Even if you don't specify the file name
	in the URL, the link will still work.
	</p>
	<a href="https://www.facebook.com/index.php">Link to Facebook home page with "index.php" specified</a>
	<xmp><a href="https://www.facebook.com/index.php">Link to Facebook home page with "index.php" specified</a></xmp>
	<a href="https://www.facebook.com/">Link to Facebook home page without "index.php" specified</a>
	<xmp><a href="https://www.facebook.com/">Link to Facebook home page without "index.php" specified</a></xmp>
	
	<hr />
	
	<p>
	Relative link / URL to a page called "child.html".  In order for this link to work, "child.html" file
	must be in the same directory as this file (links.html)
	</p>
	<a href="child.html">Relative link to a local file</a>
	<xmp><a href="child.html">Relative link to a local file</a></xmp>
	
	<hr />
	
	<p>
	Relative link / URL to a page called "subchild.html" located in a subfolder called "children".  In order for this 
	link to work, subfolder "children" must be in the same directory as this file (links.html).  "subchild.html" must be inside 
	the "children" subfolder
	</p>
	<a href="children/subchild.html">Relative link to a file inside a subfolder</a>
	<xmp><a href="children/subchild.html">Relative link to a file inside a subfolder</a></xmp>
	
	<hr />
	
	<p>
	../ notation is used to move UP in the file structure - to link to a file that is located a level up from the file containing the link.
	The link below will go one folder up in the directory structure and locate a file called "parent.html".
	</p>
	<a href="../parent.html">../ notation example</a>
	<xmp><a href="../parent.html">../ notation example</a></xmp>
	
	<p>
	Similarly, ../../ will move two levels up in the file structure.
