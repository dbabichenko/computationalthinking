    "Hangman is a paper and pencil guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes, representing each letter of the word. \n",
    "* If the guessing player suggests a letter which occurs in the word, the other player writes it in all its correct positions. \n",
    "* If the suggested letter does not occur in the word, the other player draws one element of a hanged man stick figure as a tally mark.\n",
