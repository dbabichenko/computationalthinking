    "## Pig Latin Translator\n",
    "\n",
    "Pig Latin is a language game or argot in which words in English are altered, usually by adding a fabricated suffix or by moving the onset or initial consonant or consonant cluster of a word to the end of the word and adding a vocalic syllable to create such a suffix. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, \"Wikipedia\" would become \"Ikipediaway\" (the \"W\" is moved from the beginning and has \"ay\" appended to create a suffix). \n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to conceal the words from others not familiar with the rules. The reference to Latin is a deliberate misnomer; Pig Latin is simply a form of argot or jargon unrelated to Latin, and the name is used for its English connotations as a strange and foreign-sounding language. It is most often used by young children as a fun way to confuse people unfamiliar with Pig Latin.\n",
