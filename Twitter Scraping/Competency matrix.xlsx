    "## Tweet Generator\n",
    "The goal of this exercise is to introduce you to Natural Language Generation (NGL) in Python, as well as some basic functions to work with Twitter data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical approach to creating a Twitter Bot is taking an existing twitter profile, training a model on those tweets, and generating new tweets. With this approach, we can create a bot copy of that existing twitter account, like [Gatrick Pallagher](https://twitter.com/PitttChancellor), based on the Twitter of Pitt's Chancellor, Patrick Gallagher. Your goal is to write a script that can take any twitter handle as input and generates new tweet-length text based on that profile's tweets. You do not need to fully set up a bot to tweet out those new tweets, just generate them.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will use a few python packages to create this script. [Tweepy](http://www.tweepy.org/) will be necessary to pull tweets from Twitter, and using it will [require you apply for a Twitter developer account](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-twitter-app). You'll also need a package to generate new text based off of the existing tweets. We'll use both [Markovify](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify) and [textgenrnn]()."
