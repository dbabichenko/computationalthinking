    "In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher,\n",
    "Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques.\n",
    "It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a\n",
    "letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3,\n",
    "D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar,\n",
    "who used it in his private correspondence. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you wanted to shift 'A' by three spaces, the algorithm will be as follows:\n",
    "    (1) Convert 'A' to its ASCII value (65).\n",
    "    (2) Add 3 to 65, to get 68.\n",
    "    (3) Convert the ordinal 68 back to a letter ('D')\n",
    "    \n",
    "** CHALLENGE **\n",

    "In this case, our input will be a string of text that has already been encrypted using\n",
