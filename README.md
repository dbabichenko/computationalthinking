# Computational Thinking Workshop

## Description
No prior programming skills?  No problem! The Computational Thinking workshop is a 4-week hands-on course that will provide an introduction to computational thinking, programming, and basic data processing using Python, HTML, and JavaScript. The course will focus on learning the basics of Python programming language in the context of solving problems and answering questions using computational approaches.  You will learn to  plan, design, and implement software programs, leverage commonly-used algorithms, create simple web pages, and programmatically download and process data from social media websites.
